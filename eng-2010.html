            The biggest surprise for me during the experience of this course is
            the importance of process. At the beginning of the semester, I was
            prepared for the writing involved by the experience I had in Eng 1010,
            but the idea of investigating a social justice issue and presenting
            an intervention seemed a bit magical. Yet each step of the course took
            me through the steps of the process in a way that has definitely
            impacted me for the better. I now feel much less intimidated by the
            idea of future writing projects, and feel more willing to engage in
            the smaller steps that make it possible to created polished finished work.
