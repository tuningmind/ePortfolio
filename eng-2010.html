            <summary>Reflection</summary>
            The biggest surprise for me during the experience of this course is
            the importance of process. At the beginning of the semester, I was
            prepared for the writing involved by the experience I had in Eng 1010,
            but the idea of investigating a social justice issue and presenting
            an intervention seemed a bit magical. Yet each step of the course took
            me through the steps of the process in a way that has definitely
            impacted me for the better. I now feel much less intimidated by the
            idea of future writing projects, and feel more willing to engage in
            the smaller steps that make it possible to created polished finished work.

            <h3>Polarization in Present-Day US Politics</h3>
            <p>The United States at present is in a time of heightened public disagreement and widespread public polarization. National pollsters report that parents want their children to date and marry only partners from the same political party (Pew). Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at a town hall, “We are a nation of people who have stopped being friends with people because [of whom] they voted for in the last election” (Transcript of CNN Town Hall). Unstable individuals hearing the rhetoric seem to feel impelled toward acts of violence. However, science has advanced in ways that let scientists in many fields understand behavior change and make recommendations for social action. Do scientists agree on actions citizens can take?</p>
            <p>When we’re looking for reasons for the current state of polarization, a good list is given by David Bernstein, as a preface to his own recommendations for action. He lists “echo chambers created by the internet, radical politicians elected in gerrymandered districts, the role of money in politics, angry economically marginalized voters and the pervasive use of negative campaigning” (Bernstein). But all of those possible causes imply sweeping solutions that feel out of reach to average citizens. He then asks the question so many of us are asking ourselves: “What part can we, individual citizens, play in restoring civility to our democracy?” He answers,  “It starts with guarding our own tongues.” We should, he says, all use less fiery rhetoric and learn to be civil to those who see differently. But what does it mean to use less fiery rhetoric? What drives people who try to talk peacefully into using fiery rhetoric? People may start out intending to talk peacefully, but perceive the other person as threatening. How can one be civil to someone who is perceived as threatening? Although Bernstein’s advice sounds good, it lacks specifics.</p>
            <p>Coming from another perspective, Park presents the idea that we have much in common (Park). Polarization, says Park, is an umbrella term that does not capture enough of the ways in which we could differ. By separating out features of disagreement, it is possible to observe that the public is less divided on moral issues, and it is mainly the symbolic alignment on which disagreement along partisan lines is most pronounced. In other words, we may agree more than we realize on what to do, but we are sorting ourselves into polar labels. While this might not tell us what to do to counter polarization, it suggests that there’s a lot we don’t need to do.</p>
            <p>So what might be driving Park’s symbolic alignment? If Harrington is right about the geographic playing out of lifestyle choices, should members of the other party colonize the other’s geography, like Israelis settling in the West Bank? Because of the internet, we can probably stay home and look at other venues. For example, one study found as early as 2002 that when we use computers to communicate, we’re more likely to become polarized (Choon-Ling). They observed that if we don’t see cues about a person being present, we’re more likely to perceive conversation partners as members of an outgroup. Being anonymous increases the effect. In addition, social psychologist Fiske finds that the words we choose to describe someone and the questions we ask about them determine which part of the brain is used to think about them (Fiske). She describes neuroimaging studies showing that word choices describing another person in, for example, sexual terms, activate the area of the brain used for manipulating objects. Other language describing another person as someone who has preferences lights up the area of the brain used for identifying the other person as having “a mind like me.” In particular, questions that ask the subject to imagine the other person’s mind lessen dehumanization. There are observable differences in the brain scans even if the question is as simple as “What vegetables do you think this person likes?” This intriguing finding, along with the outgroup effect Choon-Ling’s group found, finally gives concrete ideas for how to counter polarization.</p>
            <p>Along somewhat similar lines regarding communication word choice and medium, Lakoff theorizes that the metaphors embedded in our word choices imply and evoke the values we think we are discussing when we have public conversations (Lakoff). Republicans draw from an organizing metaphor he calls the “Strict Father,” with accompanying values of self-reliance, hard work, obedience, and promoting “Strict Father” views. Democrats draw from a metaphor he calls the “Nurturing Mother,” with accompanying values of fairness, inclusion, and helping. When we use language in public that describes the other side, we inadvertently trigger references to these very different metaphors. In this way, Lakoff says, our public language can inadvertently cause defensiveness. However, Lakoff’s description of conservative views has a negative tone. It would be difficult to come away from reading Lakoff thinking “Conservatives really have a point!” While his recommendations may make sense for liberals wanting to disseminate liberal values, they describe a scenario where polarization is addressed by having liberal values win the argument. If, as Park and Harrington say, there is less disagreement than we think, an attitude of winning at the cost of all you hold dear seems more likely to produce the fiery rhetoric Bernstein advises against.</p>
            <p>Solutions Journalism is a network of journalists dedicated to addressing the way journalism have a responsibility to the problems they are reporting. Journalist Amanda Ripley writes that polarization is driven by oversimplification, and journalists can head this off - and still remain objective - by writing about ways in which the narrative is oversimplified. She recommends they focus more on how people got to where they are, and how they feel about it, rather than simple he-said-she-said accounts: “less like a lawyer’s opening statement and more like an anthropologist’s field notes” (Ripley). In one sense this agrees with Lakoff’s idea that the metaphors behind our narratives invoke values, because Ripley wants the presence of detail to change the narrative. But the idea of specifically changing the narrative by introducing more detail seems very promising.</p>
            <p>There is another way in which changing narratives should be handled, according to Tavris and Aronson, who write about the processes that make it hard for people to backtrack once they have publicly committed themselves to an idea. They find that we get more willingness to change if we don’t engage in public shaming for previous failed efforts. If we regard failures as experiments that give vital information, we can reward people for experimenting even if the experiment fails. We should, they say, give social rewards for changing one’s mind and for experiments, even those that fail (Tavris and Aronson). Lakoff’s description feel militant in a way that wants to stamp out the “Strict Father” metaphor, a tone that Tavris and Aronson indicates is highly likely to meet resistance. Ripley’s increasing detail in order to complicate the narrative, however, seems to comply with the recommendation to avoid shaming.</p>
            <p>The classroom is another place we might find answers to the question “What part can we, individual citizens, play in restoring civility to our democracy?” Yaeger et. al. found that in teaching situations, mistrust of the teacher’s motivations undermines student motivation when the social feedback is ambiguous. When feedback signals can be interpreted in more than one way, students rely on existing beliefs about whether the other person can be trusted. The nature of the feedback matters, and the authors describe trust-evoking feedback as “wise.” By using wise feedback, the authors found that a sense of belonging can be cultivated.  There are three recommendations for making wise feedback: “Critical feedback must be conveyed as a reflection of the teacher’s high standards and not their bias. The student must be assured that he or she has the potential to reach these high standards, lessening the possibility that they are being viewed as limited. Students must also be provided with the resources, such as substantive feedback, to reach the standards demanded of them” (Yeager). Although this is directed at student-teacher interactions, these easy-to-understand action points suggest specific ways to connect with people who label themselves differently than ourselves.</p>
            <p>Two additional studies have useful insights for progress. Schlosser et. al. brought face to face African Americans and Jewish Americans observed to have prejudice towards each other, to explore how they could work together. When the authors shared their own motivations for being there, group members were more willing to share their own motivations, which made it possible for all there to recognize that the two groups share many cultural values and beliefs (Schlosser). In another study, MacDonald et. al. shared stories with Israelis and Palestinians.  This work was based on the idea that similarity of attitudes and values tends to increase interpersonal liking, but threatens one’s unique social identity. However, the short-term nature of emotions provides a vector for similarity that does not threaten social identity, and humanizes the outgroup. Their work suggests that activists should focus on emotional similarity.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, polarization has multiple causes and avenues of change, but several stand out as have particular effectiveness for individuals to enact. By understanding that we’re not as far apart as it seems but have sorted ourselves into unnecessarily polarized groups, we can work on bringing people together face to face. We can craft conversations based on thinking about what the other person’s preferences might be, the details of how they got to their views, and how we’re emotionally similar. If we have criticisms, we can accompany them with lots of belonging cues, and reward those who change their minds. Framed in this way, our fiery rhetoric has a viable alternative to seeing the outgroup as a threat: see them as someone like ourselves.</p>

              <h3>A Shout-Out for Humans: A Graphic Appeal to Similarity</h3>
              <p>
                The topic of my research is depolarization of American voters, 
                and from my research I’ve identified that a good target for int
                ervention is humanization of the other side. While there are 
                many strategies that can foster humanization, one I’m focusing on here is to raise the idea of both sides being human using a bumper sticker or t-shirt design. By using a medium that is easy to access and spread, it could in principle be easy to reach a large number of people whose political alignment is not just my own social group or neighborhood. Anyone driving near the bumper sticker could see it, and anyone walking near someone wearing the t-shirt could see it. Social media could also reach a lot of people, but as Sia et. al. (2002) found, an electronic medium between those posting and viewing the message has a dehumanizing effect. With a bumper sticker or t-shirt, there is an awareness that this particular person put the sticker on the car I’m seeing, or wore the t-shirt I’m seeing. This connection could contribute to the sense of a real person behind the message. In the design itself, my idea is to use the letters of “Republican” and “Democrat” to spell the word “Human,” echoing our common connection. </p>
              <p>My overall goal with the design is to have the word “Human” easily readable at first glance, and at second glance, the names of the parties. To accomplish this, I have placed the word “Republican” above the word “Democrat,” with the letters u, m, a, and n much larger than the rest of the lower-case letters. In addition, the letters u, a, and n that have been pulled from the word “Republican” are moved below their baseline, and the “m” from “Democrat” is moved above its baseline, in order to evoke the idea of reaching across a gap or aisle, yet still having them be part of both the party names and the word “Human.” </p>
              <p>Overall, there are two considerations for combining the words. One is the appearance of the lower-case letters of the party names. A number of fonts could be suitable, with the requirement that they must be easy to recognize quickly. A san-serif font allows the space to be used all on the essential letter shapes without decoration. I am currently using Avenir Next for its roundness and uncluttered use of space. Whatever size makes the lower-case letters make maximum use of the width of the sticker or t-shirt, I will call 1em, in keeping with a convention from making websites. 1em can be thought of as a unit size, and could represent, say, a 80pt font in this paper, or a 160pt font on a bumper sticker. The actual size of the unit would be determined when working with the printing company. The colors of the 1em-sized letters would be red for the letters from Republican, and blue for the letters from Democrat, since those colors already well established in the culture. The letters u, m, a and n will be black, bold, moved towards the line between the words, and 2em, twice the size of the other letters, so that they will be read as part of the super-imposed word “Human.”</p>
              <p>The other consideration for combining the words, how to make the H appear, arises because the H in “Human” is not present in either word. I have chosen to simply  place an H at the beginning of the letters, with the same characteristics as the rest of the letters in “Human.” Placing the H at the beginning, however, has the shortcoming of stranding the H by itself in a way that has no obvious meaning. Could a feature like that make the H seem forced, and by extension, subtly suggest that “the other side” can only be thought of as human by some forced and meaningless method? </p>
              <p>It seems worthwhile to see if there is a way to combine the R and D artistically to create an H. The shape of the H could be such that it appears the same font and color as the letters u, m, a, and n that have been pulled out of the party names. One spacing issue that arises immediately on attempting this second H-placement is that the letters of the two party names would have to be spaced differently in order to make sense, since the D has to be close enough to the R to be able to be combined. I would then want to move the rest of the letters in “Democrat” so they are spaced the same distance apart. I decided against this because the difference between the two party names seems greater when their spacing is different. Meanwhile, combining the R and D requires some artistry and suitable software. What I would like to do is use a more sophisticated painting program to make both R and D distinct and recognizable without effort, and show the H growing from them. I would also like to ask for advice from art and typography experts to explore this option.</p>
              <p>Although the idea of a bumper sticker seemed very promising to me at first, and people have been enthusiastic about the design, this overlooks an important consideration. MacDonald et. al. (2017) point out that reminders of group similarity can threaten social identity. In light of this, a bumper sticker reminding Democrats and Republicans that we are both human could inadvertently strengthen partisanship. For this reason, a t-shirt design might have more potential than a bumper sticker, because it has the potential to facilitate a face to face conversation.  In addition, I added a website, either Better Angels or Living Room Conversations, which offers an implied invitation. This could be a part of a larger strategy to help people make opportunities to talk to others with different views and to look for ways to find emotional similarity. Overall, the t-shirt design seems like a good contribution to a larger campaign to create ways to humanize others and seek similarity across the political divide. </p>
