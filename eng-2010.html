            My biggest take-away from the experience of this course is
            the power of process. 
          </p>
          <p>

            At the beginning of the semester, while I was
            prepared for the writing involved by the experience I had in Eng 1010,
            the idea of investigating a social justice issue and presenting
            an intervention seemed a bit magical. I could imagine some of the 
            writing, but could not imagine what I would wind up proposing or
            how I would decide what to propose. 
          </p>
          <p>

            Just prior to enrolling in this class I had completed a 12-week 
            professional training. The essence of the training was to become 
            aware of fears that had been flitting quickly by, triggering panic. 
            I learned to slow down and to craft experiences that could teach my 
            flitting brain to stay engaged. In a class where an entire project 
            is assigned, as in “Submit an annotated bibliography of 5 articles,” 
            the student is left to figure out all the process and pieces. In the 
            past, that’s the sort of thing my brain wanted to panic about.        
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet each step of this course took me through incremental steps that 
            completely matched the what I had learned in the training. Every 
            step felt understandable. “Pick a topic you care about,” was the 
            first one. That was not hard to identify, because I had been talking 
            to my friends about polarization. “Write about why you care about 
            this topic,” was the next one. That took a bit more thought, but it 
            was a single topic to reflect on; why do I care about polarization? 
            That single question made it easy to work on the assignment. Fitting 
            the answer into the genre provided, flash memoir, felt like a natural 
            way to write about the answer, and made sense of the writing choices. 
            “Now make a proposal for what to research,” was the next. That seemed 
            nicely open-ended, because I could “just” describe what my expectations 
            were. None of these steps seemed scary, or engaged the panic fairy. 
            Each one had a clear question and purpose and a set of guidelines 
            for making choices. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember the first time we did a timed free-writing. The instruction 
            to not cross out and to keep writing seemed challenging at first. My 
            brain desperately wanted me to come up with a final product, and my 
            hand balked. But the other assignments had worked, and I felt like 
            the instruction was sympathetic to me, and I was willing to try 
            venturing into that blank space. There was something very elegant-feeling 
            about having the free-writing be graded only for submission, 
            and not on content. It felt like a bow to my process. 
          </p>

            Talking to other students about their drafts was also a sneakily 
            powerful experience, especially for Project 2. Having to get that 
            draft ready for a due date was motivating in a couple of ways. Of 
            course, we always talk about due dates at school, but here, the due 
            date was part of a process, not only with separate grades for that 
            process, but for classmates to read, rather than the teacher. This 
            did something really powerful. It was surprisingly motivating to have 
            something to show my classmates, yet surprisingly gentle to not have 
            to make an “actual” submission. In each case when we were doing peer 
            reviews, I felt unprepared to put ideas to paper, but because of the 
            well-crafted push and pull of the assignment, I felt willing to throw 
            down whatever I had in mind at that point. And the big surprise was, 
            it was just fine. Just like in the other training I’d had prior to 
            this class, once my brain slowed down enough to engage with the 
            process, panic had no basis. I could experience that my writing was 
            good enough. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be hard to overstate the power of that kind of recognition. 
          </p>

            As I worked on Project 1 and 2, and even for much of the way through 
            Project 3, I had an idea for what I might wind up doing for the 
            Intervention piece. As it turned out, the idea I wound up with at 
            the end was quite different. But it’s clear to me that the effort 
            to do all the intervening steps made it possible for me to relax 
            enough to come up with a good idea. It seemed last minute, but in 
            fact it was engaging with the process all semester that made the 
            final idea possible. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I now feel much less intimidated by the idea of future writing 
            projects, and feel more willing to engage in the smaller steps that 
            make it possible to created polished finished work.</p>
