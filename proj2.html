            <h3 class='bold'>Polarization in Present-Day US Politics</h3>
            <p>The United States at present is in a time of heightened public disagreement and widespread public polarization. National pollsters report that parents want their children to date and marry only partners from the same political party (Pew). Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at a town hall, “We are a nation of people who have stopped being friends with people because [of whom] they voted for in the last election” (Transcript of CNN Town Hall). Unstable individuals hearing the rhetoric seem to feel impelled toward acts of violence. However, science has advanced in ways that let scientists in many fields understand behavior change and make recommendations for social action. Do scientists agree on actions citizens can take?</p>
            <p>When we’re looking for reasons for the current state of polarization, a good list is given by David Bernstein, as a preface to his own recommendations for action. He lists “echo chambers created by the internet, radical politicians elected in gerrymandered districts, the role of money in politics, angry economically marginalized voters and the pervasive use of negative campaigning” (Bernstein). But all of those possible causes imply sweeping solutions that feel out of reach to average citizens. He then asks the question so many of us are asking ourselves: “What part can we, individual citizens, play in restoring civility to our democracy?” He answers,  “It starts with guarding our own tongues.” We should, he says, all use less fiery rhetoric and learn to be civil to those who see differently. But what does it mean to use less fiery rhetoric? What drives people who try to talk peacefully into using fiery rhetoric? People may start out intending to talk peacefully, but perceive the other person as threatening. How can one be civil to someone who is perceived as threatening? Although Bernstein’s advice sounds good, it lacks specifics.</p>
            <p>Coming from another perspective, Park presents the idea that we have much in common (Park). Polarization, says Park, is an umbrella term that does not capture enough of the ways in which we could differ. By separating out features of disagreement, it is possible to observe that the public is less divided on moral issues, and it is mainly the symbolic alignment on which disagreement along partisan lines is most pronounced. In other words, we may agree more than we realize on what to do, but we are sorting ourselves into polar labels. While this might not tell us what to do to counter polarization, it suggests that there’s a lot we don’t need to do.</p>
            <p>So what might be driving Park’s symbolic alignment? If Harrington is right about the geographic playing out of lifestyle choices, should members of the other party colonize the other’s geography, like Israelis settling in the West Bank? Because of the internet, we can probably stay home and look at other venues. For example, one study found as early as 2002 that when we use computers to communicate, we’re more likely to become polarized (Choon-Ling). They observed that if we don’t see cues about a person being present, we’re more likely to perceive conversation partners as members of an outgroup. Being anonymous increases the effect. In addition, social psychologist Fiske finds that the words we choose to describe someone and the questions we ask about them determine which part of the brain is used to think about them (Fiske). She describes neuroimaging studies showing that word choices describing another person in, for example, sexual terms, activate the area of the brain used for manipulating objects. Other language describing another person as someone who has preferences lights up the area of the brain used for identifying the other person as having “a mind like me.” In particular, questions that ask the subject to imagine the other person’s mind lessen dehumanization. There are observable differences in the brain scans even if the question is as simple as “What vegetables do you think this person likes?” This intriguing finding, along with the outgroup effect Choon-Ling’s group found, finally gives concrete ideas for how to counter polarization.</p>
            <p>Along somewhat similar lines regarding communication word choice and medium, Lakoff theorizes that the metaphors embedded in our word choices imply and evoke the values we think we are discussing when we have public conversations (Lakoff). Republicans draw from an organizing metaphor he calls the “Strict Father,” with accompanying values of self-reliance, hard work, obedience, and promoting “Strict Father” views. Democrats draw from a metaphor he calls the “Nurturing Mother,” with accompanying values of fairness, inclusion, and helping. When we use language in public that describes the other side, we inadvertently trigger references to these very different metaphors. In this way, Lakoff says, our public language can inadvertently cause defensiveness. However, Lakoff’s description of conservative views has a negative tone. It would be difficult to come away from reading Lakoff thinking “Conservatives really have a point!” While his recommendations may make sense for liberals wanting to disseminate liberal values, they describe a scenario where polarization is addressed by having liberal values win the argument. If, as Park and Harrington say, there is less disagreement than we think, an attitude of winning at the cost of all you hold dear seems more likely to produce the fiery rhetoric Bernstein advises against.</p>
            <p>Solutions Journalism is a network of journalists dedicated to addressing the way journalism have a responsibility to the problems they are reporting. Journalist Amanda Ripley writes that polarization is driven by oversimplification, and journalists can head this off - and still remain objective - by writing about ways in which the narrative is oversimplified. She recommends they focus more on how people got to where they are, and how they feel about it, rather than simple he-said-she-said accounts: “less like a lawyer’s opening statement and more like an anthropologist’s field notes” (Ripley). In one sense this agrees with Lakoff’s idea that the metaphors behind our narratives invoke values, because Ripley wants the presence of detail to change the narrative. But the idea of specifically changing the narrative by introducing more detail seems very promising.</p>
            <p>There is another way in which changing narratives should be handled, according to Tavris and Aronson, who write about the processes that make it hard for people to backtrack once they have publicly committed themselves to an idea. They find that we get more willingness to change if we don’t engage in public shaming for previous failed efforts. If we regard failures as experiments that give vital information, we can reward people for experimenting even if the experiment fails. We should, they say, give social rewards for changing one’s mind and for experiments, even those that fail (Tavris and Aronson). Lakoff’s description feel militant in a way that wants to stamp out the “Strict Father” metaphor, a tone that Tavris and Aronson indicates is highly likely to meet resistance. Ripley’s increasing detail in order to complicate the narrative, however, seems to comply with the recommendation to avoid shaming.</p>
            <p>The classroom is another place we might find answers to the question “What part can we, individual citizens, play in restoring civility to our democracy?” Yaeger et. al. found that in teaching situations, mistrust of the teacher’s motivations undermines student motivation when the social feedback is ambiguous. When feedback signals can be interpreted in more than one way, students rely on existing beliefs about whether the other person can be trusted. The nature of the feedback matters, and the authors describe trust-evoking feedback as “wise.” By using wise feedback, the authors found that a sense of belonging can be cultivated.  There are three recommendations for making wise feedback: “Critical feedback must be conveyed as a reflection of the teacher’s high standards and not their bias. The student must be assured that he or she has the potential to reach these high standards, lessening the possibility that they are being viewed as limited. Students must also be provided with the resources, such as substantive feedback, to reach the standards demanded of them” (Yeager). Although this is directed at student-teacher interactions, these easy-to-understand action points suggest specific ways to connect with people who label themselves differently than ourselves.</p>
            <p>Two additional studies have useful insights for progress. Schlosser et. al. brought face to face African Americans and Jewish Americans observed to have prejudice towards each other, to explore how they could work together. When the authors shared their own motivations for being there, group members were more willing to share their own motivations, which made it possible for all there to recognize that the two groups share many cultural values and beliefs (Schlosser). In another study, MacDonald et. al. shared stories with Israelis and Palestinians.  This work was based on the idea that similarity of attitudes and values tends to increase interpersonal liking, but threatens one’s unique social identity. However, the short-term nature of emotions provides a vector for similarity that does not threaten social identity, and humanizes the outgroup. Their work suggests that activists should focus on emotional similarity.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, polarization has multiple causes and avenues of change, but several stand out as have particular effectiveness for individuals to enact. By understanding that we’re not as far apart as it seems but have sorted ourselves into unnecessarily polarized groups, we can work on bringing people together face to face. We can craft conversations based on thinking about what the other person’s preferences might be, the details of how they got to their views, and how we’re emotionally similar. If we have criticisms, we can accompany them with lots of belonging cues, and reward those who change their minds. Framed in this way, our fiery rhetoric has a viable alternative to seeing the outgroup as a threat: see them as someone like ourselves.</p>
