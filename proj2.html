              <summary>Writing Prompt</summary>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                  After your initial invention activities, the next part of 
                  effective research writing is finding, reading, and 
                  understanding many different credible sources about your 
                  topic. For this project, you will not only need to read 
                  sources in order to understand them individually, but you 
                  will also need to consider them together in order to 
                  understand the different conversations happening about your 
                  topic. In essence, you need to understand how your sources 
                  work together to paint a picture of the accepted information 
                  and controversies surrounding your social issue. This is a 
                  skill called synthesis and is often considered the hardest 
                  part of the research process; however, without understanding 
                  a topic in this way, it’s impossible to form a clear and 
                  effective argument about it.
                </p>
              <h4>Written Elements</h4>
                <p>
                  In this project, you will return to the familiar academic essay form to write a paper detailing the conversations and controversies surrounding your topic as evidenced by a number of credible research sources. This combination of summary and synthesis is often called a “literature review” and can be found in many kinds of writing across academic and professional disciplines.
                </p>
                <h4>Evaluation Criteria:</h4>

                <p>
                  Physical Requirements: 1800 words in length. This paper must be typed, double-spaced, in 12 point Times New Roman font, and must have 1 inch top and bottom margins and 1 inch left and right margins. It should also make use of additional formatting conventions consistent with an academic style like MLA or APA.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your Rhetorical Situation: Consider your audience for this text to be reasonably intelligent, reasonably well-educated readers in an academic setting who have an interest in your topic but very little prior information about it. This means that you’ll need to explain the basics of your social issue in addition to the points of synthesis that you discover over the course of your research.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Content: This paper should be an informative essay that brings together the information provided by your sources. Your goal is to identify patterns and trends in the arguments that people put forth regarding your topic, not to put forth an argument yourself. For example, you may find that there is one area of discussion that has three different common points of view. You may also find different areas of discussion that have no significant disagreements. This critical essay will focus mostly on the areas of disagreement in order to help you with potential areas of intervention for Project 3, but identifying areas of agreement can also be helpful in establishing places of common ground for both you and the reader. To help you in this process, we will be going over a method known as stasis in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Structure and Cohesion: Like other academic papers that you have likely written, this paper is an essay. Essays must have a central thought that clearly and consistently guides the direction of the paper. In the case of this project, your central thought will be about the major issues being discussed by experts and professionals. With such complex ideas in this paper, it is especially important that you begin and conclude your paper effectively through framing paragraphs that help the reader to understand the overall organization and content of the essay. Your supporting ideas, in this case, each of the agreements/disagreements that you’ve identified, should be organized in a logical manner, progressing from point to point in a way that is easy for your audience to follow. Additionally, be sure that the individual parts of your essay are well connected and flow together appropriately through the use of effective cohesive language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Source Usage: Because this is a research essay, you are expected to integrate no fewer than TWELVE (12) credible sources of information. This requirement also means that you will need to find and consider many more sources than this before you decide upon the sources that will best serve your writing in this project. With these sources, you will need to consider the content and group them together in ways that demonstrate the ongoing conversations happening around your social issue. You will need to summarize, paraphrase, or directly quote these sources in order to effectively demonstrate how they come together to represent a variety of topics and points of view surrounding your social issue. Beyond the writing itself, you are also expected to correctly use an academic citation style that matches your formatting style, such as MLA or APA.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mechanics and Style: As with every project in this class, a certain degree of conformity to the dialect of Edited American English is expected. You are also expected to use a style that is clear, engaging, and rhetorically appropriate. Keep in mind that this document is still being written for academic purposes.
                </p>

            <h3 class='bold'>Polarization in Present-Day US Politics</h3>
            <p>
              The United States at present is in a time of heightened public 
              disagreement and widespread public polarization. National pollsters 
              report that parents want their children to date and marry only partners 
              from the same political party (Pew). Republican Senator Marco 
              Rubio said at a town hall, “We are a nation of people who have 
              stopped being friends with people because [of whom] they voted 
              for in the last election” (Transcript of CNN Town Hall). Unstable 
              individuals hearing the rhetoric seem to feel impelled toward acts 
              of violence. However, science has advanced in ways that let 
              scientists in many fields understand behavior change and make 
              recommendations for social action. Do scientists agree on any 
              actions citizens can take?
            </p>
            <p>
              When we’re looking for reasons for the current state of polarization, a good list is given by David Bernstein, as a preface to his own recommendations for action. He lists “echo chambers created by the internet, radical politicians elected in gerrymandered districts, the role of money in politics, angry economically marginalized voters and the pervasive use of negative campaigning” (Bernstein). But all of those possible causes imply sweeping solutions that feel out of reach to average citizens. He then asks the question so many of us are asking ourselves, what can individual citizens do about the polarization we see? We should, he says, all use less fiery rhetoric and learn to be civil to those who see differently. But what does it mean to use less fiery rhetoric? What drives people who try to talk peacefully into using fiery rhetoric? People may start out intending to talk peacefully, but perceive the other person as threatening. How can one be civil to someone who is perceived as threatening? Although Bernstein’s advice sounds good, it lacks specifics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coming from another perspective, a survey of rural and small town Americans by the Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation shows important cultural differences between rural and urban residents. In the survey responses, rural residents state that they believe their values are very different from urban residents, including a strong sense of identity with other rural residents, and suspicious attitudes about who gets help in society. Rural Americans were more likely to say that others are getting unneeded handouts, to believe that the government is not good at improving living standards, and that the government does more to help people in urban areas. At the same time, these areas went heavily to Republicans in the 2016 elections. It is possible to observe that where people live has a surprisingly large correlation to voting polarity. Although this does not give us a mandate for what to do, it does give us something a bit more specific than guarding our tongue; perhaps it lets us know who to talk to and what values might be driving them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the survey gives us indications of what values are different between the political polarities, Park presents the idea that we have much in common (Park). Polarization, says Park, is an umbrella term that does not capture enough of the ways in which we could differ. By separating out features of disagreement, it is possible to observe that the public is less divided on moral issues, and it is mainly the symbolic alignment on which disagreement along partisan lines is most pronounced. In other words, we may agree more than we realize on what to do, but we are sorting ourselves into polar labels. While this might not tell us what to do to counter polarization, it suggests that there’s a lot we don’t need to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what might be driving Park’s symbolic alignment? If geography is central to playing out of cultural choices, should members of the other party colonize the other’s geography, like Israelis settling in the West Bank? Because of the internet, we can probably stay home and look at other venues. For example, one study found as early as 2002 that when we use computers to communicate, we’re more likely to become polarized (Sia). They observed that if we don’t see cues about a person being present, we’re more likely to perceive conversation partners as members of an outgroup. Being anonymous increases the effect. In addition, social psychologist Fiske finds that the words we choose to describe someone and the questions we ask about them determine which part of the brain is used to think about them (Fiske). She describes neuroimaging studies showing that word choices describing another person in, for example, sexual terms, activate the area of the brain used for manipulating objects. Other language describing another person as someone who has preferences lights up the area of the brain used for identifying the other person as having “a mind like me.” In particular, questions that ask the subject to imagine the other person’s mind lessen dehumanization. There are observable differences in the brain scans even if the question is as simple as “What vegetables do you think this person likes?” This intriguing finding, along with the outgroup effect Sia’s group found, finally gives concrete ideas for how to counter polarization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along somewhat similar lines regarding communication word choice and medium, Lakoff theorizes that the metaphors embedded in our word choices imply and evoke the values we think we are discussing when we have public conversations (Lakoff). Republicans draw from an organizing metaphor he calls the “Strict Father,” with accompanying values of self-reliance, hard work, obedience, and promoting “Strict Father” views. Democrats draw from a metaphor he calls the “Nurturing Mother,” with accompanying values of fairness, inclusion, and helping. When we use language in public that describes the other side, we inadvertently trigger references to these very different metaphors. In this way, Lakoff says, our public language can inadvertently cause defensiveness. However, while his recommendations may make sense for liberals wanting to disseminate liberal values, they describe a scenario where polarization is addressed by having liberal values win the argument. If, as Park says, there is less disagreement than we think, an attitude of winning at the cost of all you hold dear seems more likely to produce the fiery rhetoric Bernstein advises against.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the public discussions about politics, journalists have been central to the debate. Solutions Journalism is a network of journalists dedicated to not just the content of the news, but also addressing the way journalists describe the news, holding that they have a responsibility to the problems they are reporting. Journalist Amanda Ripley writes that polarization is driven by oversimplification, and journalists can head this off - and still remain objective - by writing about ways in which the narrative is oversimplified. She recommends they focus more on how people got to where they are, and how they feel about it, rather than simple he-said-she-said accounts: “less like a lawyer’s opening statement and more like an anthropologist’s field notes” (Ripley). In one sense this agrees with Lakoff’s idea that the metaphors behind our narratives invoke values, because Ripley wants the presence of detail to change the narrative. But the idea of specifically changing the narrative by introducing more detail seems very promising.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is another way in which changing narratives should be handled, according to Tavris and Aronson, who write about the processes that make it hard for people to backtrack once they have publicly committed themselves to an idea. They find that we get more willingness to change if we don’t engage in public shaming for previous failed efforts. If we regard failures as experiments that give vital information, we can reward people for experimenting even if the experiment fails. We should, they say, give social rewards for changing one’s mind and for experiments, even those that fail (Tavris and Aronson). Lakoff’s description feel militant in a way that wants to stamp out the “Strict Father” metaphor, a tone that Tavris and Aronson indicates is highly likely to meet resistance. Ripley’s increasing detail in order to complicate the narrative, however, seems to comply with the recommendation to avoid shaming.
            </p>
            <p>
              The classroom is another place we might find answers to the question of what we, as individual citizens, can do about polarization. Yaeger et. al. found that in teaching situations, mistrust of the teacher’s motivations undermines student motivation when the social feedback is ambiguous. When feedback signals can be interpreted in more than one way, students rely on existing beliefs about whether the other person can be trusted. The nature of the feedback matters, and the authors describe trust-evoking feedback as “wise.” By using wise feedback, the authors found that a sense of belonging can be cultivated.  There are three recommendations for making wise feedback. The first is that critical feedback has to be explained as coming from the teacher’s high standards and not from bias. The second is that the student must be assured that he or she has the potential to reach these high standards, so they will be less likely to think they are being described as less capable. The third is that students must also be given what they need to reach the high standards they’re being asked to meet, including guiding feedback (Yeager). Although this is directed at student-teacher interactions, these easy-to-understand action points provide a starting point to craft specific ways to connect with people who label themselves differently than ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two additional studies have useful insights for progress. Schlosser et. al. brought face to face African Americans and Jewish Americans observed to have prejudice towards each other, to explore how they could work together. When the authors shared their own motivations for being there, group members were more willing to share their own motivations, which made it possible for all there to recognize that the two groups share many cultural values and beliefs (Schlosser). In another study, MacDonald et. al. shared stories with Israelis and Palestinians.  This work was based on the idea that similarity of attitudes and values tends to increase interpersonal liking, but threatens one’s unique social identity. However, the short-term nature of emotions provides a vector for similarity that does not threaten social identity, and humanizes the outgroup. Their work suggests that activists should focus on emotional similarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, polarization has multiple causes and avenues of change, but several stand out as have particular effectiveness for individuals to enact. By understanding that we’re not as far apart as it seems but have sorted ourselves into unnecessarily polarized groups, we can work on bringing people together face to face. We can craft conversations based on thinking about what the other person’s preferences might be, the details of how they got to their views, and how we’re emotionally similar. If we have criticisms, we can accompany them with lots of belonging cues, and reward those who change their minds. Framed in this way, our fiery rhetoric has a viable alternative to seeing the outgroup as a threat: see them as someone like ourselves.
