            Does My Friend’s Uncle’s Early Death Prove That Exercise Doesn’t 
            Protect against Heart Disease?
          </h2>
          <h4>Writing prompt:</h4>
          <p class='italic'>
            You ask your friend if she wants to go to the gym with you. “No,” 
            she says, “I never exercise.” You tell her that regular exercise 
            has all kinds of health benefits, including greatly reducing the 
            risk of heart disease.  “I don’t believe that,” she replies, “I 
            had an uncle who got up at 6 am every day of his life to go 
            jogging, and he still died of a heart attack at age 53.” What 
            would you tell your friend?  Does her uncle’s case prove that 
            exercise really doesn’t protect against heart disease after all?
          </p>
          <p>
            My friend has some confused beliefs about heart attacks and heart 
            disease. Heart disease doesn’t necessarily mean having heart 
            attacks, and heart attacks can sometimes happen even without 
            heart disease. She is also confused about what risk means; her 
            response shows she believes that risk is in one person, so that 
            if you exercise, you should not have heart disease. She also 
            seems to believe that if someone who exercises dies of a heart 
            attack, then exercise did not protect them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If she believes these things, probably she would not change her 
            mind just because I gave her a list of facts and logical arguments. 
            So the main thing I would tell her is “You should go to the gym 
            with me because you’re my friend and I want your company, and I’m 
            going to the gym now.” But if there were signs that she was willing 
            to consider another perspective, I would say something like the 
            following:
          </p>
          <p class="quote" >
            That doesn’t prove that exercise doesn’t protect against heart 
            disease. There are lots of other reasons your uncle could have 
            died from a heart attack even though he exercised every day. Maybe 
            he had one of those rare kinds of heart attacks that are caused by 
            exercise (like Long-QT Syndrome1). Maybe he would have died a lot 
            sooner if he had not been exercising. Maybe he would not have died 
            if he was closer to help. Maybe he had higher risk because of his 
            parents’ heart health, that we don’t know about.
          </p>
          <p class="quote" >
            Also, risk isn’t for one person. It’s for a whole population, just 
            like one person doesn’t make a city. If you had a whole city, the 
            city wouldn’t be in the people. Risk of heart disease isn’t in one 
            person either, it’s over a population of people. You can find your 
            own risk of heart disease using the 
            <a class='a-plain'
              href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease-risk/itt-20084942#"> 
            risk score calculator from the 
            Mayo Clinic</a>. If you mark yourself as sedentary, record your score, 
            then do it again and mark yourself active, you can see how much of 
            a difference in risk you have of heart disease in the next 30 years. 
            But this is just a possibility based on what is known from hundreds 
            of thousands of people. When you mark all your risk factors as good 
            in the calculator, there is still some risk that you will come down 
            with heart disease. The risk does not go down to zero. It wouldn’t 
            have gone down to zero for your uncle either.

            And I’m sorry he died so young. You must have loved him. Would you 
            like to tell me about him?

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <h4>Writing Prompt:</h4>
          <p class='italic'>
            Think about significant learning you experienced as a result of 
            being in this course either based in course content or the process 
            of taking the course. You can tell it is significant because it is 
            something you learned or did in this course that is helpful for you 
            now or will be helpful in your future, or because it was so 
            interesting that you found you just kept thinking about it or 
            wanted to share it with important people in your life, or because 
            it allowed for an important change in your understanding of the 
            world, or because it is part of connections you are making across 
            your courses, education, or life.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most significant experiences for me a result of taking this course is the realization that I have already read so much about psychology on my own. There were very few studies described in the course which I was not already familiar with, or principles we discussed that I did not already know as distinct principles of psychology. This was really noticeable to me in the unit on the brain, where I already knew the names and some of the functions of almost every brain area we discussed. In that case, it was noticeable to me that the only structure we discussed which I had not already heard of was the tegmentum. Of course, there was new material, and the class interactions were interesting on their own. It was also good to take the time to try to really understand conditioning, where I’d always been confused about the difference between the neutral stimulus and the conditioned stimulus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason this is significant to me is that I have spent a number of years pursuing a technical education, and wasn’t aware that I had been pursuing so much psychology reading “on the side,” so to speak. At some point various experiences in the technology industry made me look around more, which eventually led this semester to me deciding to change my major to social work. While this decision felt right as soon as I considered it, it was still a surprise to me that I already had been reading so much of the material without really being aware of what I was doing. When I decided to go into technology, I went in with full energy, and the subject required intense focus, so I suppose I didn’t have the mental space to really attend to the meaning of what I was doing in my spare time. I suppose I can say I am surprised at how surprised I am!
