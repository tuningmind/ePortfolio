            <p>
              My plans begin with completing an AS in General Studies at SLCC
              in the Summer of 2019. Beginning in Fall of 2019 I will work on a 
              Bachelor's of Social Work at the Univeresity of Utah.
              I then plan to obtain a Masters of Social Work and an LCSW,
              and to go into clinical practice working with alienated families, 
              high-functioning autism, anxiety disorders, or a number of other
              specialties.
