                This course provides an introduction to Biological Anthropology, 
                one of the subfields of Anthropology and includes surveys of hominid 
                fossils, primate biology and behavior, human biological variation, 
                ecology and adaptation and evolutionary theory.

                    Discuss the appearance of bipedalism and large brain size in the hominid line. Describe each trait in detail, including the physical changes in the bones that are markers for the trait. Critically evaluate which appeared first in hominid evolution giving evidence from the fossil record for each.

                <h4>Bipedalism and Brian Size</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bipedalism is one of the defining features of homo sapiens, along with distinctive cognitive features. What are the features of bipedalism, and how are they related to the brain size that undergirds our cognitive structures?

                        Tuttle (no date) describes indicators of bipedalism. Human bipedalism depends more on the alignment of the joints and bones than on muscles. Thighbones are aligned with their leg bones and the femurs slant toward the midline so that knees and feet are under the center of mass in the pelvis. The pelvis has a short ilia with a short, broad sacrum so that muscles of the upper limbs are not required for walking. The ilia are also curved forward, allowing some of the gluteal muscles to stablize the hip as the foot swings forward. The feet are also different. The heel is strong, and the big toe is aligned with the other four toes. The midfoot has a stable arch rather than a mobile midfoot as with other primates, giving the human foot more strength. In addition, the foramen magnum is under the skull so that the head is atop the spinal column, rather than having the foramen magnum at the rear as for other, stooping, primates.

                        Originally, bipedalism was thought to follow larger brain size. However, Donald Johanson found the fossil known as Lucy (Au. afarensis), which was bipedal but had small brain (Johanson & Edey, 1981). This lead to the understanding that bipedalism came first, which is the current consensus. As the biologist Richard Dawkins wrote, “Our uniquely big brains evolved after our habit of walking on two legs. . . It is probably no accident that our brain started swelling like an evolutionary balloon after our hands were freed from the burden of walking and could concentrate on carrying food or manipulating tools” (2013).

                        Why might bipedalism have preceded larger brain size? Tuttle describes a number of possible reasons have been proposed, among them that climate change produced thinner forests and grasslands between wooded areas, which favored the changes of bipedalism. Bipedalism also left the hands free for carrying food, and tool use could allow shorter arms and straighter finger bones.

                        Falk and colleagues write of the obstetric dilemma that arose from bipedalism. Being more upright made hips narrower and decreased the birthing area in the pelvis. However, in other primates, the metopic suture (MS) covering the plates of the skull is fused during gestation, which constrains head size. As bipedalism arose, Falk et al describe how the MS began to be fused after birth, allowing heads to be larger at birth to fit through the narrower bipedal pelvis. The MS then closed later, during the first few years of life. This also had “the added advantage of allowing for the pattern of modern human brain growth” (Costandi, 2012).

                        An even more compelling causal relationship is suggested by Grabowski and colleagues (2016). Using computational processes, they modelled genetic connections between brain size and body size. As species transitioned from those with smaller brains, selection pressures also produced increased body size. This could cause confusion if the two traits are considered separately, because selection pressures might be confused with genetic covariance. Grabowski and colleagues believe that the bigger brain size was probably the driver of change, and while larger body size likely helped with the transition from smaller-brained species, eventually the larger brain could covary with a variety of body sizes. These changes working together also would have created pressure for richer food sources such as meat.

                        Altogether, the influences towards walking bipedally and toward body and brain size drove adaptations to various conditions and allowed a wide variety of human behaviors. Each step was a small one for our ancestors, but the change between now and then is a large one for humankind.
