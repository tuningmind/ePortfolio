                    <p class='italic'>
                        This site is built using knowledge gained from my programming 
                        courses, with the consent of my web development instructor. 
                        Although it does not use the Digication platform, it has 
                        been lovingly maintained using skills I gained here
                        at SLCC. It uses custom HTML and CSS, and is published on Github Pages.
