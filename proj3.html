              <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                  So far this semester, we have devoted an entire project to the process of invention in order to carefully consider a social issue from multiple perspectives, and an entire project to the process of research in order to gain a fuller understanding of the conversations happening around that social issue. For our final project, we’ll be putting the understanding that you’ve gained through these projects into practice. You will choose one of the disagreements that you discovered in Project 2 and enter into the conversation. Choosing an appropriate audience, you will craft a rhetorical intervention on the social issue.
                </p>
              <h4>Written Elements:</h4>
                <p>
                  This project will have two parts: (1) a multimodal (including both textual and visual elements) composition designed to make an argument about your social issue to a specific audience, and (2) an essay describing the rhetorical choices that you made in designing and creating your intervention.
                </p>

                <h4>Rhetorical Intervention Evaluation Criteria:</h4>

                  <p>
                    Physical Requirements: The formatting for this element of the project will depend entirely upon the genre that you choose to work with. The only physical requirement for this element of the project is that you must include both textual and visual elements of some kind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your Rhetorical Situation: For this portion of the project, you must choose an audience to focus upon for your persuasion. The argument that you make, the audience that you choose, and the genre that you work with must all be both appropriate for your social issue and must also all work well together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Content: As with the other elements of this part of the project, the content will largely depend upon your choices of audience and genre; however, the goal of the content must be to persuade your intended audience of a particular idea related to your social issue. This idea could be to take up a position that they don’t have already, to consider a point of view that they may not have been exposed to already or that they may have discounted, to act in specific ways upon a position that they already hold, or any other goal appropriate to your audience and social issue. Regardless of what you choose as your rhetorical goal for this part of the project, the argument must be clear, well-supported, and appropriate for the audience and genre.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Structure and Cohesion: As with the physical requirements, the structure of this portion of the project will be based upon the genre that you choose to work with. That being said, the general principles of coherence and cohesion still apply to any form of writing that you may do. The focus should be clear and consistent throughout the document, and the individual pieces of the composition should be clearly connected for a single, cohesive document. We’ll be talking about visual design principles during this project to aid you in creating coherence and cohesion in visual texts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Source Usage: No research is required for this project; however, most arguments that you may make about social issues will likely require some kind of expert support. Additionally, while all sources do need to be acknowledged, most public genres typically don’t make use of an academic citation style like MLA or APA. You’ll want to look at genre-specific conventions for referencing sources for whichever genre you choose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mechanics and Style: As with every project in this class, a certain degree of conformity to the dialect of Edited American English is expected. That being said, depending up on your genre, some adaptations or exceptions to strict Edited American English may be appropriate. You’ll need to make these decisions as you research the conventions of the genre that you choose to work with. You should also consider how your writing style should shift for your audience as well, particularly in the areas of tone and formality.
                  </p>

                <h4>Explanation Evaluation Criteria:</h4>

                  <p>
                    Physical Requirements: 600 words minimum. This paper must be typed, double-spaced, in 12 point Times New Roman font, and must have 1 inch top and bottom margins and 1 inch left and right margins. It should also use either MLA or APA formatting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your Rhetorical Situation: For this report, you are writing a formal, professional report explaining the rhetorical choices that you made in the other part of this project. Much like the second project, your audience is both your classmates and your instructor. Make sure that your language and tone are appropriate to this situation. You may assume that your audience is familiar with your rhetorical intervention but will not have it in front of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Content: This report should provide your reader with detailed information about the choices that you made in designing and constructing the rhetorical intervention portion of this project. This will, at minimum, include the audience, purpose, context, and genre that you’ve worked with. Other things that you may explain include which visual elements you’ve included, the research used to support your argument, the tone/formality/vocabulary, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Structure and Cohesion: While there are some differences between this assignment and Project 2, a professional report and an academic essay have a lot in common when it comes to organization. Effective reports must have a central thought that clearly and consistently guides the direction of the paper. Begin and conclude your review effectively through framing paragraphs that help the reader to understand the overall organization and content of the essay. Your supporting ideas should be organized in a logical manner, progressing from point to point in a way that is easy for your reader to follow. Additionally, be sure that the individual parts of your report are connected effectively and flow together through the use of effective cohesive language that helps your reader to see the connections between your ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Source Usage: No research is required for this part of the project; however, you do need to adequately reference the elements of your rhetorical intervention in order to demonstrate the choices that you’ve made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mechanics and Style: As with every project in this class, a certain degree of conformity to the dialect of Edited American English is expected. You are also expected to use a style that is clear, engaging, and appropriate for your rhetorical situation.

            <h3 class='bold'>A Shout-Out for Humans: A Graphic Appeal to Similarity</h3>

              <p>
                The topic of my research is depolarization of American voters, 
                and from my research I’ve identified that a good target for 
                intervention is humanization of the other side. While there are 
                many strategies that can foster humanization, one I’m focusing 
                on here is to raise the idea of both sides being human using a 
                bumper sticker or t-shirt design. By using a medium that is easy 
                to access and spread, it could in principle be easy to reach a 
                large number of people whose political alignment is not just my 
                own social group or neighborhood. Anyone driving near the bumper 
                sticker could see it, and anyone walking near someone wearing 
                the t-shirt could see it. Social media could also reach a lot 
                of people, but as Sia et.al. (2002) found, an electronic medium 
                between those posting and viewing the message has a dehumanizing 
                effect. With a bumper sticker or t-shirt, there is an awareness 
                that this particular person put the sticker on the car I’m seeing, 
                or wore the t-shirt I’m seeing. This connection could contribute 
                to the sense of a real person behind the message. In the design 
                itself, my idea is to use the letters of “Republican” and “Democrat” 
                to spell the word “Human,” echoing our common connection. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My overall goal with the design is to have the word “Human” 
                easily readable at first glance, and at second glance, the 
                names of the parties. To accomplish this, I have placed the 
                word “Republican” above the word “Democrat,” with the letters 
                u, m, a, and n much larger than the rest of the lower-case 
                letters. In addition, the letters u, a, and n that have been 
                pulled from the word “Republican” are moved below their baseline, 
                and the “m” from “Democrat” is moved above its baseline, in 
                order to evoke the idea of reaching across a gap or aisle, yet 
                still having them be part of both the party names and the word 
                “Human.” 
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, there are two considerations for combining the words. 
                One is the appearance of the lower-case letters of the party names. 
                A number of fonts could be suitable, with the requirement that 
                they must be easy to recognize quickly. A san-serif font allows 
                the space to be used all on the essential letter shapes without 
                decoration. I am currently using Avenir Next for its roundness 
                and uncluttered use of space. Whatever size makes the lower-case 
                letters make maximum use of the width of the sticker or t-shirt, 
                I will call 1em, in keeping with a convention from making websites. 
                1em can be thought of as a unit size, and could represent, say, 
                an 80pt font in this paper, or a 160pt font on a bumper sticker. 
                The actual size of the unit would be determined when working with 
                the printing company. The colors of the 1em-sized letters would be 
                red for the letters from Republican, and blue for the letters 
                from Democrat, since those colors already well established in 
                the culture. The letters u, m, a and n will be black, bold, 
                moved towards the line between the words, and 2em, twice the 
                size of the other letters, so that they will be read as part of 
                the super-imposed word “Human.”</p>
              <p>
                The other consideration for combining the words, how to make the 
                H appear, arises because the H in “Human” is not present in either 
                word. I have chosen to simply  place an H at the beginning of the 
                letters, with the same characteristics as the rest of the letters 
                in “Human.” Placing the H at the beginning, however, has the 
                shortcoming of stranding the H by itself in a way that has no 
                obvious meaning. Could a feature like that make the H seem forced, 
                and by extension, subtly suggest that “the other side” can only 
                be thought of as human by some forced and meaningless method? 
              </p>
              <p>
                It seems worthwhile to see if there is a way to combine the R and 
                D artistically to create an H. The shape of the H could be such 
                that it appears the same font and color as the letters u, m, a, 
                and n that have been pulled out of the party names. One spacing 
                issue that arises immediately on attempting this second H-placement 
                is that the letters of the two party names would have to be spaced 
                differently in order to make sense, since the D has to be close 
                enough to the R to be able to be combined. I would then want to 
                move the rest of the letters in “Democrat” so they are spaced the 
                same distance apart. I decided against this because the difference 
                between the two party names seems greater when their spacing is 
                different. Meanwhile, combining the R and D requires some artistry 
                and suitable software. What I would like to do is use a more sophisticated 
                painting program to make both R and D distinct and recognizable 
                without effort, and show the H growing from them. I would also 
                like to ask for advice from art and typography experts to explore 
                this option.
              </p>
              <p>
                 Although the idea of a bumper sticker seemed very promising to 
                 me at first, and people have been enthusiastic about the design, 
                 this overlooks an important consideration. MacDonald et.al. (2017) 
                 point out that reminders of group similarity can threaten social 
                 identity. In light of this, a bumper sticker reminding Democrats 
                 and Republicans that we are both human could inadvertently strengthen 
                 partisanship. For this reason, a t-shirt design might have more 
                 potential than a bumper sticker, because it has the potential to 
                 facilitate a face to face conversation.  In addition, I will add a 
                 website along the bottom, either Better Angels or Living Room 
                 Conversations, which offers an implied invitation. This could 
                 be a part of a larger strategy to help people make opportunities 
                 to talk to others with different views and to look for ways to 
                 find emotional similarity. Overall, the t-shirt design seems 
                 like a good contribution to a larger campaign to create ways to 
                 humanize others and seek similarity across the political divide.
