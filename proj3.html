              <p>
                The topic of my research is depolarization of American voters, 
                and from my research I’ve identified that a good target for int
                ervention is humanization of the other side. While there are 
                many strategies that can foster humanization, one I’m focusing on here is to raise the idea of both sides being human using a bumper sticker or t-shirt design. By using a medium that is easy to access and spread, it could in principle be easy to reach a large number of people whose political alignment is not just my own social group or neighborhood. Anyone driving near the bumper sticker could see it, and anyone walking near someone wearing the t-shirt could see it. Social media could also reach a lot of people, but as Sia et. al. (2002) found, an electronic medium between those posting and viewing the message has a dehumanizing effect. With a bumper sticker or t-shirt, there is an awareness that this particular person put the sticker on the car I’m seeing, or wore the t-shirt I’m seeing. This connection could contribute to the sense of a real person behind the message. In the design itself, my idea is to use the letters of “Republican” and “Democrat” to spell the word “Human,” echoing our common connection. </p>
              <p>
                My overall goal with the design is to have the word “Human” easily readable at first glance, and at second glance, the names of the parties. To accomplish this, I have placed the word “Republican” above the word “Democrat,” with the letters u, m, a, and n much larger than the rest of the lower-case letters. In addition, the letters u, a, and n that have been pulled from the word “Republican” are moved below their baseline, and the “m” from “Democrat” is moved above its baseline, in order to evoke the idea of reaching across a gap or aisle, yet still having them be part of both the party names and the word “Human.” </p>
              <p>
                Overall, there are two considerations for combining the words. One is the appearance of the lower-case letters of the party names. A number of fonts could be suitable, with the requirement that they must be easy to recognize quickly. A san-serif font allows the space to be used all on the essential letter shapes without decoration. I am currently using Avenir Next for its roundness and uncluttered use of space. Whatever size makes the lower-case letters make maximum use of the width of the sticker or t-shirt, I will call 1em, in keeping with a convention from making websites. 1em can be thought of as a unit size, and could represent, say, a 80pt font in this paper, or a 160pt font on a bumper sticker. The actual size of the unit would be determined when working with the printing company. The colors of the 1em-sized letters would be red for the letters from Republican, and blue for the letters from Democrat, since those colors already well established in the culture. The letters u, m, a and n will be black, bold, moved towards the line between the words, and 2em, twice the size of the other letters, so that they will be read as part of the super-imposed word “Human.”</p>
              <p>
                The other consideration for combining the words, how to make the H appear, arises because the H in “Human” is not present in either word. I have chosen to simply  place an H at the beginning of the letters, with the same characteristics as the rest of the letters in “Human.” Placing the H at the beginning, however, has the shortcoming of stranding the H by itself in a way that has no obvious meaning. Could a feature like that make the H seem forced, and by extension, subtly suggest that “the other side” can only be thought of as human by some forced and meaningless method? </p>
              <p>
                It seems worthwhile to see if there is a way to combine the R and D artistically to create an H. The shape of the H could be such that it appears the same font and color as the letters u, m, a, and n that have been pulled out of the party names. One spacing issue that arises immediately on attempting this second H-placement is that the letters of the two party names would have to be spaced differently in order to make sense, since the D has to be close enough to the R to be able to be combined. I would then want to move the rest of the letters in “Democrat” so they are spaced the same distance apart. I decided against this because the difference between the two party names seems greater when their spacing is different. Meanwhile, combining the R and D requires some artistry and suitable software. What I would like to do is use a more sophisticated painting program to make both R and D distinct and recognizable without effort, and show the H growing from them. I would also like to ask for advice from art and typography experts to explore this option.</p>
              <p>
                 Although the idea of a bumper sticker seemed very promising to me at first, and people have been enthusiastic about the design, this overlooks an important consideration. MacDonald et. al. (2017) point out that reminders of group similarity can threaten social identity. In light of this, a bumper sticker reminding Democrats and Republicans that we are both human could inadvertently strengthen partisanship. For this reason, a t-shirt design might have more potential than a bumper sticker, because it has the potential to facilitate a face to face conversation.  In addition, I added a website, either Better Angels or Living Room Conversations, which offers an implied invitation. This could be a part of a larger strategy to help people make opportunities to talk to others with different views and to look for ways to find emotional similarity. Overall, the t-shirt design seems like a good contribution to a larger campaign to create ways to humanize others and seek similarity across the political divide. </p>
