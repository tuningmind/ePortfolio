            <h5>A movement to depolarize America</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>November 2018</h5>
            <p>
              This summer I had the opportunity to observe a 6-hour workshop held
              by <a href='http://better-angels.org' class='a-plain'>Better Angels</a>.
              Eight Republicans and eight Democrats sat down to share with
              each other what it feels like in the current US political climate.
              They came in tense and on guard, hopeful and worried. As the 
              exercises proceeded, they sat back a little and their faces 
              relaxed. Tension was replaced by curiosity and tentative hope. 
              By the end of the workshop, small groups of Republicans and 
              Democrats were standing around chatting on their own. They 
              expressed some realistic hope that it might be possible for us
              to work together on both sides of the aisle. No one expressed
              unguarded optimism, and there was still a sense that there is a 
              lot of work to do, but there was definitely a change in how they
              felt in each other's presence. 
              This is what I want to work to facilitate. 
            </p>
            <h5>January 2019</h5>
            <p>This month I wanted to try my hand at organizing and running
              a Better Angels-style workshop. I'm not yet a certified moderator, but
              I wanted to see what it might be like, so I invited two blues and
              two reds together and ran two of the exercises from the red-blue
              workshop. One of the participants had a hard time understanding the
              stereotypes exercise, and found it difficult to respond to the hypothetical
              "what does the other side think of my side?" This turned out to make
              it difficult for that person to get the benefit of humanizing the
              others. It made me wonder whether the workshop design might be
              unintentionally geared for a higher education level. I'd like to try
              this again with a less educated group and see how we could work with
              that. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also very difficult for some of the participants to stick with
              thinking about what the other side believes about itself rather than
              trying to defend their own position. The conversation guidelines 
              for red-blue workshops are that participants are not there to change
              each other's minds, so I had to exercise my moderator hat to keep 
              the conversation away from arguing positions. It was challenging 
              and exhilarating, and intervening made the event more meaningful for
              everyone than if people talked without guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite that, though, it was very gratifying to see the way it affected
              people to hear the other side describe what they care about. Reds
              described how unsafe they felt in another country and how that affects
              their views about the wall. Blues who were guided to listen to this 
              reflected out loud that the wall had always seemed mean to them, but
              now they could consider it from the perspective of safety. I considered
              this a success moment - there were no opinions changed about the wall
              but people listened to each other with the intent to understand. 
              Very cool!
            </p>
            <h5>February 2019</h5>
            <p>
              This month I had an opportunity to attend a red-blue workshop as a
              participant. This time I got to be on the receiving end of the 
              exercises, and experience what it's like to come up with stereotypes that
              the other side has of you. For me the most interesting part came during 
              the curiosity questions. This exercise has each side coming up with 
              questions for the other side that are <i>not</i> "gotcha" questions. 
              "How could you believe that...?" is a gotcha question. "What do you
              believe about...?" is a curiosity question. These turned out to feel
              quite humbling and, in a way, intimate. The rules did not allow for
              follow-up questions on this, but the openness it generated left us
              wanting further conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I should add that this group had some people who are on the farther
              sides of their respective groups, including a socialist who thinks 
              we are not socialist enough, and an anti-abortion activist. So the
              experience of feeling warm and curious toward the other side seemed
              especially noticeable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the participants even wrote up a newspaper article for his local paper
              about this event:

            <h5>March 2019</h5>
            <p>
              This month I have organized a follow-up meeting with the reds and blues
              that were at the February workshop. We'll be meeting again with half reds and half
              blues. Instead of doing the perspecitive-taking exercises from the
              red-blue workshop, we'll be seeing what it's like to continue the
              conversation on specific topics. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the things I've noticed about these meetings is that the presence
              of a moderator makes all the difference in how well the conversations go.
              It also makes all the difference that the conversation is not open to 
              whatever type of interaction people want, but directed to specific
              activities that have been shown to increase perspective-taking. Since
              this next meeting will not include the specific activities, I want to
              do something else to make sure the conversations are directed. There are
              several ideas from previous meetings that I want to use. One is to read 
              at the beginning a statement about what rules we will use during the 
              conversation, and ask everyone's permission for me to act as moderator 
              and hold us accountable for using those rules. That would be for things 
              that help keep it civil and on-topic. Next I want to have everyone 
              list topics they would want to cover in this conversation, and then vote,
              so that we are talking about a topic that is relevant to everyone there. 
              And then I want to review the difference between a "gotcha" question and
              a curiousity question, and have our questions of each other be vetted with
              a partner before being actually posed to the other side. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't wait! 
            </p>
            <h5>June 2019</h5>
            <p>
                Next steps for me and Better Angels: I finally took the plunge and applied
                to become a moderatorr. It will take a few weeks to hear back, and they are
                just in the middle of putting on their yearly convention, so I don't expect
                to hear back for a couple of weeks yet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also met with another member in the area who is interested in getting
                involved but has a different emphasis. She likes to do the organizing kind
                of activities that I don't love to do, so it looks like it will be a good
                pairing. It's great to have a like-minded soul to work with and figure out
                how to move forward. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So many Americans are concerned about the tone of public discourse in our country -
                it's a great time to get involved with the depolarization movement!

                <li>The Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society 
                  <span>by Nikolas Christakis</span> 
                  <p>
                    Zoom out from human history and look at humans in evolutionary 
                    time. Early on, we became social, and from there, any feature
                    that increased survival when we cooperated was selected for. 
                    It had to be so, or we would either not have survived, or 
                    we would not be social. It's easy to feel grim when focused
                    on smaller timespans, especially since it was also beneficial 
                    for survival to pay more attention to potential danger than
                    to what's already working. But Christakis argues that we 
                    should remember evolutionary time, because "The arc of history 
                    is long, but it bends towards goodness."

                  <span>by Kevin Brockmeier</span> 
                  <p>
                    At 8:17 on a Friday night, wounds begin to glow. Every pain
                    and injury everyone has becomes a light source that everyone
                    can see. Headaches are a soft glow over the head, leukemia
                    a shining light from the bones that looks like holding a 
                    flashlight up to your hand, cuts flare out a spear of light.
                    At the same time, a journal consisting of a wife's
                    record of all the love notes her husband has given her every 
                    day finds its way into the hands of a series of other people
                    who are touched by it. "I love the soft blue veins on your 
                    wrist. I love your lopsided smile. I love watching TV and 
                    shelling sunflower seeds with you." Pain and love in a weird
                    but touching story.

                <li>The Bondwoman's Narrative 
                  <span>by Hannah Crafts</span> 
                  <p>
                    Possibly the first novel written by a black woman slave,
                    I was surprised at how gripping I found the story. The 
                    manuscript for this novel turned up a few years ago, and the
                    story of its authentication is also fascinating. The description
                    of how the paper was tested and text examined and so on
                    reminds me of The Weight of Ink (reviewed below) and made
                    both stories more meaningful. The historians figure that
                    the story is mostly autobiographical, so the drama of dealing
                    with different masters and the daring escapes seem all the 
                    more real.

                  <span>by David Brin</span> 
                  <p>
                    A physicist falls into an alternate world where the laws of 
                    physics don't quite work the same. Devices of all kinds can
                    be formed, but the more they are used, the more suited for that
                    use they become. If you leave things around without using
                    them, they forget what they were for. The combination means
                    that objects have to constantly be practiced for their use.
                    A stick of wood with a rough stone used as a hammer
                    becomes increasingly well shaped and held together the more it is
                    used to hammer with; a wall becomes thicker where it is touched.
                    Poor people are employed sitting in chairs so they can become more
                    chair-like, rich people are followed around by servants with the 
                    same body type who are wearing clothes that get improved by wearing. 
                    A funny and inventive way to think about how things can be 
                    different - and the same.

                    We want to be the heroes of our story, and in some sense a 
                    therapist is someone who helps you rewrite your story to one
                    you can bear to be in - a kind of story doctor. In the research
                    literature, it's called reappraisal or reframing, but a story
                    doctor is my kind of story.

                <li>The Five Types of People Who Can Ruin Your Life 
                  <span>by Bill Eddy</span> 
                  <p>
                    There actually are people who can ruin your life. It is not just
                    for tv shows. They have traits that make them recognizable, and
                    Eddy, who started out as a therapist and then became in turn a
                    mediator and lawyer, is expert at picking out the ones who will
                    suck the life out of you. I had assumed it was people who were 
                    mentally ill or personality disordered, but lots of them just
                    go about living their lives as best they can, he says, without
                    causing any grief. It's the ones who are willing to hurt you
                    that he warns against, and shares the surprisingly common strategies
                    and traits you can identify them with. I would send this to my
                    younger self, in repeated deliveries, so that if she didn't 
                    read the first copy she found, maybe she'd read it if she
                    came across it enough times. Like seatbelts and teaching little 
                    kids how to recognize who they shouldn't talk to, this book is
                    something I want everyone I care about to know.

                  <p>
                    A doctor discovers he has terminal cancer, and chooses to
                    write about the process of coming to terms with death and
                    dying. While reading this, you can't help feeling your own 
                    humanity, and pondering how you want to spend your life.

                  <span>by Carlo Rovelli</span> 
                  <p>
                    A physicist writes about the strange properties of the universe
                    that generate the human experience of time. Strange and fascinating. 
                    I many have thought that time dilation was for tiny, super-speedy
                    particles, but turns out we can feel it - it feels like down. The
                    increased gravity closer to the earth that our feet feel is the
                    difference in the passage of time between our head and our feet. 
                    I had to walk around wondering at my feet for half a day after
                    reading this.

                <li>The Philosopher's Flight: A Novel 
                  <span>by Tom Miller</span> 
                  <p>
                    The front cover boasts "Half Science, Half Magic, Entirely Fantastic."
                    The magic and fantastic seem accurate enough, as far as the genre
                    goes, and the science is pretty un-sciency, but what makes this
                    book is the perspective of a boy who wants to grow up to do a 
                    woman's work, and isn't allowed because of sexism. Although in 
                    the story women have been flying for some decades now, it is
                    believed that men can never be as good at it as women because they
                    are just too big. He has to order special equipment to fit him,
                    and he's subject to cruel pranks at the all-women school he's being
                    allowed to attend. It's a life of a thousand paper cuts, of a boy. 
                    Lots of hilariously familiar moments had me savoring the telling
                    of this story, far more than other kinds of stories of its genre.

                <li>The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and Their
                  Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow's World
                  <span>by Charles C. Mann</span> 
                  <p>
                    One brought us wheat that could grow more than it ever had
                    before. One made us notice that the effects of our actions 
                    are affecting the entire ecosystem. Both care about saving 
                    and enriching lives. But the values that shaped their work
                    were quite different, and we see the implications playing out
                    around us.

                <li>The Last Bookaneer: A Novel 
                  <span>by Matthew Pearl</span> 
                  <p>
                    Pearl writes historical fiction set in Boston at the very 
                    beginning of MIT. At a time when engineering is viewed with
                    disdain and application of science is considered work for 
                    lesser minds, the visionary first president of MIT begins to
                    teach applied science. But naturally some forces resist, and 
                    steampunk highjinks ensue. Great fun.

                <li>The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self 
                  <span>by Thomas Metzinger</span> 
                  <p>
                    You feel like a self because a self comes into creation each
                    time you wake up. But it's a construction of the mind, probably
                    to allow different parts of the mind to communicate with each
                    other in a flexible, real-time way that is highly adaptive to
                    changing circumstance. I'm sure my description is doing an
                    injustice to Metzinger's highly nuanced arguments and cases.

                <li>The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups 
                  <span>by Daniel Coyle</span> 
                  <p>
                    The author's previous book, The Talent Code, was a game-changing
                    book for me. This one comes close to matching the impact of the
                    first, with the idea of belonging cues, which affect how groups
                    coalesce.

                  from "What Will People Think?" to "I Am Enough"
                  <span>Brene Brown</span> 
                  <p>
                    Brene Brown writes openly about feelings of shame we all 
                    prefer to hide, and normalizes our feelings in the process. 
                    I knew her message was starting to sink in when someone in 
                    a math class asked a question I was thinking about asking, 
                    and I realized that if I'd asked the question, I would have
                    seemed just as normal as that other person.

                <li>The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating
                  Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science for Greater Mindfulness
                  <span>by John Yates and Matthew Immergut</span>
                  <p>
                    Detailed instructions for why and how to notice the actions
                    of your own mind. When the title says "complete," they're not
                    kidding. This is very thorough. Not so much on the brain science,
                    though. There are few science references, although some very 
                    general brain-sounding terms are used. The main way the brain
                    science shows up is that the author does not interpret Buddhism
                    in mystical terms; karma is in this life, once-returning is a
                    state the brain can achieve through practice and has to do 
                    with attention and joy, not reincarnation. Practicing is not 
                    a mystical experience, but a very specific set of brain-training
                    activities.

                <li>The Weight of Ink 
                  <span>by Rachel Kadish</span> 
                  <p>
                    Since this one does not have ": A Novel" in the title, I have
                    to specify that this is a novel. A brilliant woman who is born
                    just before the Great Plague hits London learns to be a scholar
                    by reading for a rabbi blinded in the Inquisition. His need for
                    her reading gives her the opportunity to use her mind in a way she would
                    never be allowed to otherwise, and she out-philsophizes the most
                    gifted philosophers of her time - under a pen name. Hundreds of 
                    years later, an odd-couple of researchers discover themselves
                    other as they discover her. So many quotable lines, I plan to
                    reread this with a pencil.
