            <h5>A movement to depolarize America</h5>
            <p>
              Recently I had the opportunity to observe a 6-hour workshop held
              by <a href='better-angels.org' class='a-plain'>Better Angels</a>.
              Eight Republicans and eight Democrats sat down to share with
              each other what it feels like in the current US political climate.
              They came in tense and on guard, hopeful and worried. As the 
              exercises proceeded, they sat back a little and their faces 
              relaxed. Tension was replaced by curiosity and tentative hope. 
              By the end of the workshop, small groups of Republicans and 
              Democrats were standing around chatting on their own. They 
              expressed some realistic hope that it might be possible for us
              to work together on both sides of the aisle. No one expressed
              unguarded optimism, and there was still a sense that there is a 
              lot of work to do, but there was definitely a change in how they
              felt in each other's presence. 
              This is what I want to work to facilitate.

                <li>The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human 
                  <span>by Jonathan Gottschall</span> 
                  <p>
                    We want to be the heroes of our story, and in some sense a 
                    therapist is someone who helps you rewrite your story to one
                    you can bear to be in - a kind of story doctor. In the research
                    literature, it's called reappraisal or reframing, but a story
                    doctor is my kind of story.

                <li>The Five Types of People Who Can Ruin Your Life 
                  <span>by Bill Eddy</span> 
                  <p>
                    There actually are people who can ruin your life. It is not just
                    for tv shows. They have traits that make them recognizable, and
                    Eddy, who started out as a therapist and then became in turn a
                    mediator and lawyer, is expert at picking out the ones who will
                    suck the life out of you. I had assumed it was people who were 
                    mentally ill or personality disordered, but lots of them just
                    go about living their lives as best they can, he says, without
                    causing any grief. It's the ones who are willing to hurt you
                    that he warns against, and shares the surprisingly common strategies
                    and traits you can identify them with. I would send this to my
                    younger self, in repeated deliveries, so that if she didn't 
                    read the first copy she found, maybe she'd read it if she
                    came across it enough times. Like seatbelts and teaching little 
                    kids how to recognize who they shouldn't talk to, this book is
                    something I want everyone I care about to know.

                <li>When Breath Becomes Air 
                  <span>by Paul Kalanithi</span> 
                  <p>
                    A doctor discovers he has terminal cancer, and chooses to
                    write about the process of coming to terms with death and
                    dying. While reading this, you can't help feeling your own 
                    humanity, and pondering how you want to spend your life.

                <li>The Order of Time 
                  <span>by Carlo Rovelli</span> 
                  <p>
                    A physicist writes about the strange properties of the universe
                    that generate the human experience of time. Strange and fascinating. 
                    I many have thought that time dilation was for tiny, super-speedy
                    particles, but turns out we can feel it - it feels like down. The
                    increased gravity closer to the earth that our feet feel is the
                    difference in the passage of time between our head and our feet. 
                    I had to walk around wondering at my feet for half a day after
                    reading this.

                <li>The Philosopher's Flight: A Novel 
                  <span>by Tom Miller</span> 
                  <p>
                    The front cover boasts "Half Science, Half Magic, Entirely Fantastic."
                    The magic and fantastic seem accurate enough, as far as the genre
                    goes, and the science is pretty un-sciency, but what makes this
                    book is the perspective of a boy who wants to grow up to do a 
                    woman's work, and isn't allowed because of sexism. Although in 
                    the story women have been flying for some decades now, it is
                    believed that men can never be as good at it as women because they
                    are just too big. He has to order special equipment to fit him,
                    and he's subject to cruel pranks at the all-women school he's being
                    allowed to attend. It's a life of a thousand paper cuts, of a boy. 
                    Lots of hilariously familiar moments had me savoring the telling
                    of this story, far more than other kinds of stories of its genre.

                <li>It's All Relative: Adventures Up and Down the World's Family Tree 
                  <span>by A.J. Jacobs</span> 
                  <p>
                    A journalist embeds himself in life to see what it means - in 
                    other books, to live every commandment in the Bible, or gain
                    bodily perfection. In this one, he organizes a family reunion
                    for the entire human family.

                  Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow's World
                  <span>by Charles C. Mann</span> 
                  <p>
                    One brought us wheat that could grow more than it ever had
                    before. One made us notice that the effects of our actions 
                    are affecting the entire ecosystem. Both care about saving 
                    and enriching lives. But the values that shaped their work
                    were quite different, and we see the implications playing out
                    around us.

                  <span>by Matthew Pearl</span> 
                  <p>
                    Pearl writes historical fiction set in Boston at the very 
                    beginning of MIT. At a time when engineering is viewed with
                    disdain and application of science is considered work for 
                    lesser minds, the visionary first president of MIT begins to
                    teach applied science. But naturally some forces resist, and 
                    steampunk highjinks ensue. Great fun.

                  <span>by Thomas Metzinger</span> 
                  <p>
                    You feel like a self because a self comes into creation each
                    time you wake up. But it's a construction of the mind, probably
                    to allow different parts of the mind to communicate with each
                    other in a flexible, real-time way that is highly adaptive to
                    changing circumstance. I'm sure my description is doing an
                    injustice to Metzinger's highly nuanced arguments and cases.

                <li>The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups 
                  <span>by Daniel Coyle</span> 
                  <p>
                    The author's previous book, The Talent Code, was a game-changing
                    book for me. This one comes close to matching the impact of the
                    first, with the idea of belonging cues, which affect how groups
                    coalesce.

                  <span>Brene Brown</span> 
                  <p>
                    Brene Brown writes openly about feelings of shame we all 
                    prefer to hide, and normalizes our feelings in the process. 
                    I knew her message was starting to sink in when someone in 
                    a math class asked a question I was thinking about asking, 
                    and I realized that if I'd asked the question, I would have
                    seemed just as normal as that other person.

                <li>The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating
                  Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science for Greater Mindfulness
                  <span>by John Yates and Matthew Immergut</span>
                  <p>
                    Detailed instructions for why and how to notice the actions
                    of your own mind. When the title says "complete," they're not
                    kidding. This is very thorough. Not so much on the brain science,
                    though. There are few science references, although some very 
                    general brain-sounding terms are used. The main way the brain
                    science shows up is that the author does not interpret Buddhism
                    in mystical terms; karma is in this life, once-returning is a
                    state the brain can achieve through practice and has to do 
                    with attention and joy, not reincarnation. Practicing is not 
                    a mystical experience, but a very specific set of brain-training
                    activities.

                <li>The Weight of Ink 
                  <span>by Rachel Kadish</span> 
                  <p>
                    Since this one does not have ": A Novel" in the title, I have
                    to specify that this is a novel. A brilliant woman who is born
                    just before the Great Plague hits London learns to be a scholar
                    by reading for a rabbi blinded in the Inquisition. His need for
                    her reading gives her the opportunity to use her mind in a way she would
                    never be allowed to otherwise, and she out-philsophizes the most
                    gifted philosophers of her time - under a pen name. Hundreds of 
                    years later, an odd-couple of researchers discover themselves
                    other as they discover her. So many quotable lines, I plan to
                    reread this with a pencil.
