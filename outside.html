          <h4>Better Angels</h4>
          <h5>A movement to depolarize America</h5>
          <p>
            Recently I had the opportunity to observe a 6-hour workshop held
            by <a href='better-angels.org' class='a-plain'>Better Angels</a>.
            Eight Republicans and eight Democrats sat down to share with
            each other what it feels like in the current US political climate.
            They came in tense and on guard, hopeful and worried. As the 
            exercises proceeded, they sat back a little and their faces 
            relaxed. Tension was replaced by curiosity and tentative hope. 
            By the end of the workshop, small groups of Republicans and 
            Democrats were standing around chatting on their own. They 
            expressed some realistic hope that it might be possible for us
            to work together on both sides of the aisle. No one expressed
            unguarded optimism, and there was still a sense that there is a 
            lot of work to do, but there was definitely a change in how they
            felt in each other's presence. 
            This is what I want to work to facilitate.
