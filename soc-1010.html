          My cultural object is a crochet pillow cover I made. The cultural 
          trait it shows is a love of learning. As a child, when I was 
          fascinated by something my mother was doing, she would teach me 
          something about it. If she was reading the newspaper,
          I would sit on the floor looking up at the front page while she read
          the inside. Then we would talk about the articles. When she was knitting
          or crocheting something, I would ask her to show me, and slowly and
          carefully she showed me how to make the stitches and hold the yarn. 
          She also infected me with her love of color. But what is interesting
          here is not the object so much as the way the ability to make it came
          to me. My mother had been taught the same way by her mother, one 
          stitch at a time, making practice squares, then ripping them out to 
          do again for more practice. Who taught my grandmother? Probably her 
          mother! And my son and daughter have learned from me, continuing the 
          tradition.
