					<h2>About ENGL 1010 at SLCC</h2>
                    <p>
                        Writing matters. We use it every day to make things of value in the world. We compose grocery lists to purchase food that then forms the meal we share with our loved ones, and we develop lab reports that document our research processes and findings and then submit them to demonstrate our ability to participate in scientifically valid forms of knowledge making. We compose status updates to document and share our child’s latest developmental milestones, and we develop descriptions that pique others’ interests in the goods and services we offer on sites like Etsy and Kickstarter. Because writing underlies so many activities in our personal, academic, and civic lives, it’s worthy of our attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At SLCC, we’ve identified five concepts that provide an understanding of writing that we hope will enrich your current knowledge and serve you well as you encounter new writing situations, whether you’re studying English or welding, working as an engineer or historian. The concepts that we want you to think about and explore throughout the semester are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Language and writing are resources people use to do things, be things, and make things in the world.</li>
                            <li>Rhetoric provides a method for studying the work that language and writing do.</li>
                            <li>Writing is a form of action. Through writing people respond to problems and can create change in the world.</li>
                            <li>Writing is a processes of deliberation.  It involves identifying and enacting choices, strategies, and moves.</li>
                            <li>Effective or meaningful writing is achieved through sustained engagement in literate practices (e.g., thinking, researching, reading, interpreting, conversing) and through revision.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        With these concepts at the foundation, we will study our own writing practices as well as those of others with the primary goal of learning more about how and why writing matters. We will use rhetoric to develop knowledge of the “work” writing does in the world and to discover knowledge about our own writing practices. Major projects will develop our ability to think rhetorically about writing and to apply rhetorical thinking in our development as writers. We will compose in different genres, write for different audiences, identify various reasons for writing, and consider different purposes for the writing we produce. By the end of the semester, you will be a more flexible, adaptable writer, which will help you more confidently navigate writing tasks that you encounter in other college courses as well as those you encounter in your everyday lives beyond educational contexts.

                            This self study project is designed to facilitate your understanding of the Project 1 threshold concepts: (1) Language and writing are resources we use to do, make, and be things in the world, and (2) Effective or meaningful writing is achieved through sustained engagement in literate practices and through revision. You will research and analyze your writing practices with the goal of reaching critical insights about how you use language and writing resourcefully in your life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, you will write a 1000-1200 word portrait of yourself as a writer in a particular writing situation. Your portrait should discuss key insights about how you use, or have used, writing as a resource in your life. 
                            Ask yourself: What has been my process in this writing situation? Why does this process work to meet my purpose with my audience? What is it about my process that could be strengthened in this writing situation? What have I learned about myself as a writer by studying my process in this writing situation?

                        <h5>The Work In A Question</h5>
                        <p>
                        On my first day of a programming internship my team is given a worksheet: “When Should You Ask a Question?” At the top of the list is “Google it.” This creates an uneasy feeling. It’s not as if we haven’t googled before. Are we being set at the entrance to a vast labyrinth with nothing but a ball of string? I want access to an experienced maze guide to help me connect the next step with what I’ve learned so far. This beginning sends the signal to avoid asking questions. A friend who is learning to code also says he is often told to Google his questions. “Google is your friend,” would-be helpers say. “Google isn’t<em>my</em> friend,” he complains. Like me, he finds information posted on the internet hard to interpret without a whole network of concepts. We feel the need to be able to ask questions of an experienced programmer. So a couple of years into my effort to learn programming, I decide to try creative ways to get answers. With help from a friend, we find a client, a programming mentor and another student, get to work, and - conveniently for this exercise - create an email group to ask technical questions. A close look at this email exchange shows that even for the wisest guide it’s hard work to answer questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For the conversation I examine in this essay, there are three of us. D is the mentor, a very capable web engineer who works at a large local company. R had been working at an attorney’s office but has decided to make a career switch into programming. And me, gamely trying to learn programming without racking up student loans. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The email group provided some great writing artifacts I can use now to see what my questions and answers look like. What are my questions really like? What kind of answers do I actually get? The emails also show another kind of artifact we used in our exchanges - the error message. On one day in October 2016 we have made a copy of the client’s existing website, and are ready to put it on a different computer, called a “droplet.” On this day, I try to upload the files we’ve been creating, and find myself in a situation I’ve never been in.  I google (Google is your friend!) but what I find confuses me. (Google is not <em>my</em>friend.) 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Questioning the Questions</h5>
                        In our email group, I begin a new thread. “Hey guys,” I start out. “I’ve been looking for how to actually move files into our droplet.” This seems pretty clear to me. I have files here, on my computer, and I need to get them there, to the droplet. Better tell them what I’ve tried so they know I have thought about it: “[The command] cp works from localhost to containers, but it’s not clear to me how to have the destination container be over ssh, even for a simple copy. The tutorials I’ve seen are describing how to pull in files from Dockerhub, and how to get your own image up to Dockerhub, but it would make more sense to pull our files from GitHub in any case. Any ideas?” By describing “the tutorials I’ve seen,” I’m showing them what I’ve been trying. I’m hoping to give them some breadcrumbs to find me in the labyrinth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Reading this from two years out, it’s clear to me that I was fundamentally confused about what files were being moved where. If this conversation had not been written down, this insight would have been lost. The website we called “Dockerhub” was a location for a very different kind of file. The answers I was finding were all related to moving an irrelevant kind of file; that’s why they didn’t make sense to me. I was in a different part of the maze than I thought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        D answers, giving me easily followed instructions, and then adds, “Is this something you were asking about?” This follow-up question D asks is very interesting. He is asking a meta-question, a question about the conversation we’re having: “Is this something you were asking about?” He’s not sure where I am in the maze. He’s answered what he thinks I mean, overlooking the confusion about “Dockerhub” and guessing I need to use the thing called ssh but clarifying from where to where. And then, because he is guessing what I meant, he needs to check with me. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This pattern shows up several times. R jumps in. He has a better idea than I do of where the moving parts are connected. “We could just …” (I’ll spare you the technical details.) After his description, he asks me, “Is that what you were referring to regarding file migration?” He understands I’m talking about moving files, but he is also guessing what I meant, and needs to check to see if this helps. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Neither of them is quite sure whether they’ve answered my question, because although they understand how to do the task, they are not clear about what confuses me. The question I think is so straightforward is actually pretty confusing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        So I follow D’s instructions, which work perfectly, and when I go to run the next command, I get an error. These error messages, it turns out, are very important.  We rely on them to know where to direct our debugging efforts. I find them hard to interpret, so I copy the part I think is relevant for D to examine. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        “There must be an actual error printed above this line,”  he answers. “Can you check?” 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Huh? I thought I had the actual error. So I copy the whole error message to him, saying “Does that look like what you want?” 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Another pattern is showing up here. Instead of actually asking a question - which has been harder than expected - I just show the error message, and leave the question implied. I have done this several times in the conversation. In fact, there are 9 posts that include error messages, as much as if another person had been participating in the conversation. The error message in a way represents the whole labyrinth of learning. Every line is highly technical, and it takes a great deal of experience to make sense of it. Yet for those with experience, the error provides a rich source of information about what has been happening in your efforts, what was just attempted, and what the source of the problem may be. It’s as if you just sent up a flare from your place in the maze. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        D is so excited about that error message he forgets to confirm that’s what he wanted, and jumps directly into “Ooh awesome,” and then tells me triumphantly why the thing fails. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>It’s the Work, Stupid</h5>
                        <p id="two">
                        For D, the triumph of the solution was the satisfaction of finding and naming a problem. “Ooh awesome” is a celebration. It was work for him to find the problem, so finding the solution called for a moment of celebration. When someone is willing to answer a question, that pleasure is bound to be what draws them to the challenge. It might take only a moment to get to an answer, but it’s not obvious whether the moment will be over quickly, or take some time to figure out. When I invite someone to answer my questions, it’s as if that person is also set at the entrance to a labyrinth, the maze of what-the-student-knows. The ball of string I need to give that person consists of the clues from my own mind - what I know, what I’ve tried, and the error messages from those who made the programs I’m using. Both of us need to unroll the string of trial and error to navigate the maze.

                        <p class="indent">
                            This analysis is about an essay by Jonathan Haidt (pronounced "height") called “When and Why Nationalism Beats Globalism” in the July 2016 edition of <em>The American Interest</em>. The education level of his audience shows up in the kinds of explanations Haidt feels the need to make. They have enough education that the phrase “longitudinal research” needs no explanation, but not enough specialized education to know off-hand what the World Values Survey does. This audience is those “on the Left” (Haidt, 2016) who don’t understand “what on earth is happening in Western democracies,” and think of anti-immigrant sentiment as “mere racism.” Haidt’s purpose is to persuade the audience to stop creating “normative threat” for a certain personality type by respecting nationalist traditions. The main argument is that although prosperity has changed urban values to be more globalist, nationalists have been objecting to globalist immigration policies for a long time. The 2015 upsurge in immigration in particular has created a powerful nationalist backlash. To understand how to address this requires understanding how a personality type called authoritarian is being affected by globalism. Haidt states that immigration sets off a sense of moral instability in these people; he wants readers to understand that they can drain passion away from nationalist parties by abandoning the multicultural approach to immigration and embracing assimilation. Haidt uses two primary rhetorical strategies to persuade readers. To create understanding of what is happening he uses an appeal to facts, and to persuade globalist readers to change their approach to immigration he uses an appeal to values. He also illustrates the values to which he’s appealing by considering the values of nationalists.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent">
                            To answer the audience’s question about what is going on in Western democracies, Haidt begins with the factual claim that the change toward globalist values is predictable: “As nations grow prosperous, their values change in predictable ways.” Although the facts being cited are about values, this is a claim of fact, not a claim of value. He cites the World Values Survey, which has been surveying values around the world since 1980. He also cites Barak Obama, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and social commentators David Goodhart, George Monbiot and Christian Welzel. These quotes are all appeals to fact, demonstrating how academics and surveyors discover what large groups of people value, and how these values have changed as prosperity has increased. From theses sources he also shows that to globalists,  “patriotism is [considered] indistinguishable from racism.” He uses these facts to lay out the first point of his argument, the factual stance that immigration is central to the values of the Left. This documentation of globalist values demonstrates to the audience that he understands their values. It also begins to explain what is going on in the world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent">
                            In his next section, Haidt persuades readers that assimilation is a worthy goal by appealing to values. He describes nationalist values to globalists:
                        </p>
                        <p class="quote">
                            Nationalists see patriotism as a virtue; they think their country and its culture are unique and worth preserving. This is a real moral commitment, not a pose to cover up racist bigotry. . . as many defenders of patriotism have pointed out, you love your spouse because she or he is yours, not because you think your spouse is superior to all others. . . . Governments should place their citizens interests above the interests of people in other countries. . . There is nothing necessarily racist or base about this arrangement or social contract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The statement that nationalists see patriotism as a virtue is an appeal to value. By quoting the comparison to marriage, Haidt asks readers to think about their own values in marriage. The language about contracts also asks readers to think about their values with regard to keeping contracts. In addition, the reference to a “social contract” appeals to a history of thinking about the values between a society and its government. With all of these examples, Haidt is eliciting a perspective that allows globalist readers to consider the values of nationalists, rather than dismissing them. This is an excellent example of what he is asking them to do. As an appeal to value, this rhetorical strategy is the perfect embodiment of his point.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent">
                            In his next section, Haidt appeals to the facts about global immigration and the personality type called “authoritarian,” but also appeals to the value of understanding the interaction between the two. He refers to the work of the political scientist Karen Stenner’s in her book <em>The Authoritarian Dynamic</em>, saying that
                        </p>
                        <p class="quote">
                        . . . authoritarianism is not a stable personality trait. It is rather a <em>psychological predisposition</em> to become intolerant when the person perceives a certain kind of threat. It’s as though some people have a button on their foreheads, and when the button is pushed, they suddenly become intensely focused on defending their in-group. . . . At those times they are more attracted to strongmen and the use of force. At other times, when they perceive no such threat, they are not unusually intolerant. So the key is to understand what pushes that button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The thing that pushes the button is “a threat to the integrity of the moral order (as they perceive it).” He quotes Stenner:
                        </p>
                        <p class="quote">
                            The experience or perception of disobedience to group authorities or authorities unworthy of respect, nonconformity to group norms or norms proving questionable, lack of consensus in group values and beliefs and, in general, diversity and freedom ‘run amok’ should activate the predisposition and increase the manifestation of these characteristic attitudes and behaviors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Haidt reiterates that nationalists are “trying to protect their group or society.” All of this is a strong appeal to values, asking globalists to see another picture of what nationalists care about. He’s asking globalists to imagine, to take a walk in, the values of nationalists, by describing a positive way of looking at the desire to protect a culture. This walk is an expression of hope that the audience will be changed by imagining what nationalists care about.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent">
                            Running as a thread throughout the piece is Haidt’s own underlying value of considering people’s psychological needs. His claim is that people who care about moral stability have valid needs. The value assumption underlying Haidt’s advice is that by meeting those people’s needs, we can greatly reduce the political conflict in our country. He hopes that by sharing these values, he can persuade multiculturalists that it is worth their effort to switch to emphasizing assimilation and similarity, reminding each other of the values we hold in common.

                            Throughout the paper, Haidt has made reference to nationalists who feel threatened, who are being crushed and silenced. In the last line of his paper he asks globalists, “In what kind of world can globalists and nationalists live together in peace?” After having illustrated what it looks like to consider the values of the other side, this question hanging at the very end gives a sharp emphasis to the values of globalists. By asking this question, he appeals to globalists to change their values, and beautifully demonstrates the power of rhetoric.

                            Take Threshold Concept 1 and Threshold Concept 2 and describe what they mean. Explain how you used these concepts in your work in ENGL 1010 using specific examples from the two texts you have included in your portfolio. Explain how you have attempted to use these two concepts in another setting.  What strategies did you use as a writer accomplish this task?

                                ENGL 1010 has been organized around the idea of threshold concepts, ideas that reframe the way we see some aspect of the world. For one, writing is a resource, a way to make something happen in the world. For another threshold concept, that hand-wavy-sounding word “rhetoric” turns out to be a way to study how writing makes things happen in the world. On one hand, it seems obvious that writing does something in the world, or why would anyone do it? On the other hand, we do it so much that it has become a routine part of the water we swim in. This threshold concept points attention to the fact that we’re doing it. By itself, that might be somewhat interesting, but coupled with rhetoric to examine how we’re doing it makes it possible to be purposeful.

                                In my project 1, examining an email conversation, I spent some time noticing that in fact my writing was doing work, and fairly specific work at that. The email exchange in question was a technical exchange with a mentor and another student. The assignment tasked me with examining the exchange to see what work was being done, something that had never occurred to me to do with my writing. Once I looked at the emails with “writing as a resource” in mind, it was easy to notice patterns. I was asking the mentor and the other student how to do a specific task, and thought my questions were pretty straightforward. But examining through the lens of the threshold concept made me notice that both of them were confused about what I was asking, and although they answered my question, they didn’t know if they had until they specifically asked me “Did that answer your question?” Going into the conversation, I had been frustrated at how difficult I’ve found it to get answers to questions. Coming out of the project 1 analysis, I realized the signals that it is actually quite hard to answer student questions, and I felt more grateful for the people who had spent the time and made the effort in response to my requests.

                                In my project 2, studying an essay by moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, I was tasked with noticing specific strategies the author used to get his writing to do the work he wanted. His overall point was to get globalists to think about the moral perspective of nationalists and address their actual concerns rather than ridiculing them, but the question was how did he expect his writing to do this work? By looking at a list of common rhetorical techniques, it became apparent to me that his primary strategy was to appeal to facts and to appeal to the readers’ values. He spent a number of paragraphs developing the idea that an entire category of people has been complaining about immigration for some time now, and the recent upsurge in immigration has brought their complaints to the foreground. This was his appeal to facts, as if to point out to globalists, “Hey people, a lot of people have been disagreeing with you.” To help show why they’ve been disagreeing, he switched to appeal to values, to create examples that anyone can relate to, in order for globalists to notice that they have shared values with nationalists. And then in his final appeal he asks globalists, “What kind of world do you want to live in?” This appeal to values implies that you can fight with people who disagree with you or you can try to understand them, and you can actually do something about it rather than just complaining.

                                All in all, these have been useful insights, and I look forward to using them when I observe other people’s writing going forward, as well as being more deliberate in my own future writing.
