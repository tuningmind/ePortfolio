                <p>
                    This course will explore religion in the United States from its 
                    foundations in this country to the modern day. From the first 
                    encounters of Europeans with our native peoples to the development 
                    of parody religions such as the Church of the SubGenious or Pastafarians, 
                    we will attempt to answer the question of what role Religion has played, 
                    should play and how its consistent presence has sparked Americaâ€™s 
                    spiritual, cultural and political imagination in so many ways.
