                    <summary>Writing prompt</summary>
                    <p> 
                        Write a reflective paper about how you see yourself as 
                        a communicator, and interview others about how you 
                        communicate to reflect on their perceptions.
                        You’ll need to identify your communication abilities 
                        and learn how others perceive the way you communicate.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        In Part 1 of the assignment, you’ll complete a series 
                        of assessments to help you identify your areas of 
                        strength and weakness. After you have taken the assessments 
                        you will reflect on the assessments and your own experiences 
                        to paint a picture of how you perceive six different aspects 
                        of your communication abilities
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        In Part 2, you’ll identify and talk with three people 
                        who know you well about what it’s like to have a 
                        conversation with you. You will then reflect on the 
                        feedback you received from the people you interviewed 
                        and compare your perception with theirs.

                    <p>
                        How am I at articulating my needs, opinions, views, or concerns?
                        This has historically been a difficult area for me but it’s getting better. My adaptability score came out as 33, and empathy as 40, which are both average. On the other hand, my self-awareness came in at 19, which is highly self-aware. I notice that the situations in which my empathy and adaptability do not kick in are ones where I feel nervous about the situation itself, or where I have something else on my mind and do not feel free to discuss it. Then, my emotions dominate my thinking and keep me from adapting to the situation or being fully aware of what the other person is experiencing. Over time, this has gotten better, which shows up in me being aware of it and my scores being not lower than average in adaptability and empathy. As I continue to get better, I’m more likely to notice this dynamic while it’s happening, which makes me more empathetic and adaptable. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, I recently went to visit a celebration at the Hindu temple with my American Religions class. Because of a health issue, I was really tired that day, though, and there was a classmate whose behavior initially seemed friendly but increasingly seemed dominating. The classmate scolded me for being late, and this did not match my expectations for how he would talk to me. It felt bossy to me, though I also wondered if he was using the style “fight for fun” we just learned about in this class. It was a long ceremony, and involved moving from one place to another at points that were not clear, and several times this classmate made statements to me that felt like ordering me around - “Go outside now,” “Put your shoes on now.” I didn’t think he was necessarily saying what the people running the ceremony wanted me to do, and didn’t feel any obligation to follow his orders. But somehow I did not feel like I could express what I needed, and wound up just looking blankly at him. This is not my usual way of responding! It was noteworthy for being different. I attribute that to being tired, being in an unfamiliar environment, and judging his comments as un-called-for. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A more common example of how I express my needs happened as I was doing homework this weekend. I had been working for a while, and suddenly felt the need for a break. I got up and went outside to talk to my neighbor, who I have a friendly but infrequent relationship with. It’s a couple with three children in elementary school, and I sometimes talk to the mom. This was motivated by the recognition that the hours of focus and solitude I’d had needed some sociality to balance me out. When her kids said that their mom wasn’t home but their dad was, at first I was going to leave, but then thought of another excuse to extend the conversation. I had a bike I’d planned to give away, and it dawned on me that I could ask these people if they wanted the bike. I offered it to them, and we had a conversation about it and went and got it and they were very happy to have it. By the time they were leaving for their next activity, I felt connected and refreshed and ready to hit the books. That is typical of my style of expressing and taking care of my needs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How am I as a listener?
                        Historically I’ve had a lot of energy to do a lot of talking during conversations, and the kind of people I’ve made friends with are people who are comfortable asserting themselves too. I went through a protracted trauma in recent years, and often have needed to talk to my closest friends about it. I felt a little guilty for needing to talk so much. At the end of a conversation, it was not unusual for me to feel that I hadn’t given them the opportunity to talk. I would sometimes make myself ask them about what was going on with them, and they would tell me, but it was hard to keep paying attention while they were talking. At some point, the trauma subsided, and I wanted to catch up with what was going on with them. They’d start to tell me about something and I’d have a vague sense that I’d heard it, or even no memory of having heard it, but it would turn out to be something they’d told me during one of those try-to-listen conversations. Apparently I hadn’t actually been listening! This proved to be the case even though at the time I was going through the motions of listening.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, last week I was talking with one of my best friends, and she reminded me about something related to her fridge problem. I paused, trying to remember. I thought, “Dang it, what was the fridge problem?” Finally, I couldn’t follow the thread of what she was saying without knowing what the fridge problem was, and had to ask. Fortunately, she understands me well and wasn’t offended, and told me again about the neighbor replacing his fence who dug in the wrong place and hit their mutual power line, frying the circuitry in my friend’s fridge. Once she reminded me, I could remember that she had told me the whole story before. This is an example of how my listening is impaired when I have a lot of internal conversation going on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not always like that, though, and I would say that my baseline is to talk to people and let the conversation go wherever it comfortably goes. At the end of last semester I was talking to a classmate who had been very quiet during the semester. I said, “You’ve been so quiet, but I’ve seen how alert you look and I think you must have a lot to say. How did you come to be in this class?” Her face lit up and she began to tell me about her background. As she did, it occurred to me that it related to the content of the course, and I said so, and she responded enthusiastically to that and explained more about why. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My listening assessment came out as 35, which is in the middle, and I think this reflects the two kinds of examples I’ve given. On the one hand, when I have my own things going on, I don’t seem like I’m listening, or do seem like it but then forget what I’ve been told. On the other hand, when I’m feeling more adaptable, I come across as empathetic and people respond and share things with me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What aspects of my nonverbal behavior are effective? What can be improved?
                        This is another area where I have two modes. My immediacy score came out as 115, which is pretty high, and I was thinking of my emotionally warm mode when I was scoring that. Specifically, I was thinking of a time a few days before when I had run into a teacher from last semester, and wanted to share something exciting with her. I had an animated expression on my face, I leaned in close to talk to her, I gestured a lot, and my vocal tones varied. This incident where I displayed a lot of immediacy is pretty typical for me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have an emotionally cooler mode, when I’m tired or zoned out or feeling traumatized. At those times, my nonverbal behavior is much more limited. My facial expression is masked - usually pleasant, but not necessarily reflecting what’s going on inside. My body motions are restrained, I talk less overall, and when I do talk, my vocal tones vary less. For example, the day I went to the Hindu temple, my classmates left and I continued to stay for the dancing part of the celebration. I was fascinated by the dancing and entranced by the ethnic clothing, but I was in a bit of daze. Several times a congregation member caught my eye and smiled warmly, but rather than responding further, I smiled back and then let my eyes drift away. Although I enjoyed the dancing, I felt a bit wooden by the end of the time. Something I could have done would have been to not look away, and to lean forward toward the person. That could have easily led to some verbal communication about what was going on around us. This is something I could do more of in the future, that could help me have more interactions, and possibly help my interactions go to an additional level of engagement. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, this is a good place to mention that it’s my goal this year to practice going from the most casual levels of interaction to more friendly interactions and make more friends locally. I have close friends, but they are scattered all over the place because of the world we live in, and I often regret that I don’t have local friends I can grab a movie with or go to events with. Increasing my nonverbal engagement is a way I can create opportunities to make more friends. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What are my communication strengths?
                        One of my best communication strengths is self-awareness. I’m willing to try something different even in the middle of a conversation (as long as it comes to mind then.) For example, last semester I had a class about human behavior that made me more aware of possible life events people could be dealing with. Three of us were assigned to a project about one of the life stages. We met to talk about our project, and I could see an interaction dynamic going on that puzzled me. The two other women, Nadine and Jennifer, were talking animatedly, and Nadine was maintaining eye contact with Jennifer not looking at me much. I felt a bit invisible at first. In the past I would have taken that personally, but now I could wonder what might have been going on for Nadine, and wondered what Jennifer was doing that was effective for Nadine. I decided to just watch them when I wasn’t directly contributing, and see if I could tell. That particular moment didn’t result in any revelations, but the ability to do that makes it possible for me to learn from the communication experiences I have. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another communication strength I have is cognitive complexity. This was my highest score of the assessments, coming in at a 46. I can always think of another way to interpret what the other person is doing. If I’m nervous, I forget to consider other interpretations, but as soon as something brings re-interpreting to mind, I can come up with many, many different ways to interpret. An example occurred during the Hindu event. I had the thought several times that these people probably think I’m weird staying for the whole event; what kind of white person just trails them around their dancing without talking to anyone? But then I ran through other possibilities. I told myself that probably some people actually might think it was weird for me to be doing that but it doesn’t matter, and many people there probably don’t think that. They might be flattered that an outsider is interested in their celebration, they might interpret it in a religious way as me being influenced by their deity, they might think I look lonely and feel sympathetic, they may wish they could talk to me more, they may be curious. They may even have not noticed me at all, because they were busy thinking about their teenage girls getting dressed up in traditional costumes and doing dances that are central to their culture. In fact, going through these possibilities was the reason I stayed as long as I did, and got to see all the dances. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another communication strength I have is my rapport style. This makes me want to give people lots of conversational feedback and keep them engaged. Once I get started talking to someone, they keep talking as long as the situation indicates. Recently I was at an orientation meeting at the University of Utah, where I’m starting in the Fall, and was talking to a number of people in this way. The organizers of the event obviously sat strangers together at round tables in order to facilitate conversations, and I asked people about their planned areas of study and how they came to be interested in it. One woman sitting next to me turned out to be married to a man from Ghana, and they own a big parcel of property there. When she told me this, my face lit up - eyebrows up, leaning forward, smiling - and I asked her to tell me more. They plan to build a recreation facility for the young people in the area, and she had come to Utah to study Parks and Recreation, so that they would know how to build. I thought that was marvelous, and was so interested in what this meant to her. She responded, and shared a great deal, continuing to talk to me about the details of our orientation planning as we moved from one activity to the next. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What are my communication weaknesses?
                        My biggest communication weakness is forgetting to listen, and instead wanting to tell a conversation partner everything I can think of on the topic at hand. There are so many problems with this! On many subject, I have a long train of reasoning and examples of each train, and want to drive the whole thing home before letting the other person have a say. Some people are fascinated, and that has unfortunately been way too rewarding, so I’ve formed some bad habits about that. Conversations are not supposed to be lectures! If they listen, it makes me think we’ve had a conversation, but then they don’t seem to want to talk again, and I miss out on the opportunity to develop that relationship. I need to learn to let go of making a long-form point unless doing that is the kind of relationship we have. I do have several relationships like that! But obviously not all of them can be. Before I launch into some beloved point, I want to learn to think about what the other person may be experiencing and let them respond. For example, one time a year or so ago I was at the library, and, surprised by the number of cars there, wandered around to find what the event was. It turned out to be a meet and greet for candidates of the other party to meet voters. I decided what the heck, and waded in, listening to some of the candidates and talking to some of the avid voters who were there. One woman and I got into a conversation about how both sides need to talk to each other and not just shut each other down. It was a very animated conversation, and we wound up exchanging phone numbers. But when I tried to reach out to her, she was lukewarm, and didn’t seem interested after all. I was puzzled, because she had seemed so interested. But doing a post-mortem about the conversation, it dawned on me that I had not been listening to her, and had been way too busy telling her about the ideas I’d been nursing. Of course, I can think of a dozen other reasons why she wouldn’t want to follow up, but a reasonable one includes that I didn’t listen to her passionate ideas, and mainly told her mine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can think of a number of other areas I have weaknesses in, but maybe don’t have time here to go into them as much as I could. I’d like to make note to myself here that I can work on not upstaging people who are telling a story by telling them my supposedly better story. I can work on retraining pleaser behaviors, by making note of my needs and including them in the conversation when it’s relevant. And I can work on noticing my own anxiety, because it interferes with being in touch with my empathy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is it like to have a conversation with me? 
                        Some people find me enthusiastic and interesting, but other people find me intimidating or over-anxious. One time I was talking with my neighbor about meeting new people. She is one of the friendliest people I know, but she said that it was hard for her to go to new places and meet new people. I had told her about a number of the different communities I’ve visited recently, and she looked at me with frank astonishment, as if to say, “You actually go to those places?” In the expression on her face I saw a glimpse of what one friend has been trying to tell me for a while, that some people find me intimidating. On the other hand, some people find that inspiring. For example, after I mentioned to someone that I was trying to learn a new and difficult subject, I noticed that she had signed up for a hard class in her field. Another person also made the decision to go back to school, as I have. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the past, I used to be very anxious because I thought that people mostly found me undesirable to talk to. But as I’ve worked on self-improvement, I’ve begun to notice that many people, after they talk to me, seem to feel happy, and smile at me and say warm things as we part ways. One example of this was another student who was at the orientation at the U. This young woman was ahead of me on line for student IDs. People would go one at a time into the ID room, have their picture taken, then come back out and sit on the bench to wait for the finished ID. She went in first because she was ahead of me, then came out and sat down. When I came out from having my picture taken, there were a lot of people waiting. But since I’d talked to her a little as we waited, I sat down next to her. We talked while we sat, but when her ID was brought to her, I noticed that she did not get up. Instead she stayed to talk to me while I waited. When mine came and I got up, she got up too, and continued to talk to me until we got to the doors and were going different ways. As we parted, she smiled at me and expressed how much she’d enjoyed our conversation. I felt good, even though we’ll probably never meet again, because I felt I had connected with her for that time. Hopefully, most of the time, this is the experience most people have with me. I think it is.

                    <summary>Myself as a Communicator - Part II</summary>
                    <p>
                        Introduction - 
                        I interviewed my friend John, my friend Krista, and my oldest son, Lauren, who is 23 and on the autism spectrum. In addition, while I was talking to Krista, a 9 year old boy from our church named Leo came up to us and was included in the conversation, until his mother came up he left with her. Though that wasn’t part of the interview, it gave some interesting examples. My biggest take away from these experiences is that I probably communicate better than I thought, and can relax about some of the concerns I had about being good enough of a communicator. When I relax more, I can focus on the areas I do want to improve on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How am I at articulating my needs, opinions, views, or concerns? -  
                        The overall response was that I’m pretty good at this. Krista said that I have clarity when I express myself, and come across as having prepared and thought about what I’m saying. John said he’d give me 8 out of 10, because everyone needs room for improvement. I asked why he didn’t make it higher, and he said that when I’m in a group and speaking, I say something profound and have lots of evidence. But he wonders if I just keep quiet when I don’t have lots of evidence, and I might have something spontaneous to say that would still be interesting. Lauren’s unique critical perspective still wound up being a positive assessment of how I am at articulating my needs. He said that I’m worse than him at it, but he’s been told that he’s especially good at it. Most people, he said, are not that great at it, and some people who work very hard at it are an exception (to being not great). He said I’m better than most, but not quite to his standards. I interpret this as a combination of his autism and his intuitions; on the one hand he’s comparing me to a somewhat rigid protocol, and on the other hand he’s reacting intuitively.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        John’s response really surprised me, and felt like the mother-lode insight for this entire exercise. Krista also said something similar, though in less detail, about how my comments in conversations with them come across as being very well thought-through. It had never dawned on me that I might be only speaking when I know how to back up an idea. This gives me an idea of something I can work on. My friends would like to hear my spontaneous thoughts and feelings, not just the ones I’ve thought a lot about. This exercise reassures me that people are comfortable with how I articulate my needs and opinions, and encourages me to express myself more spontaneously.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        With Lauren, this question gave me some insight into the fact that he really does find it difficult to perceive information about social interactions. My friends found these questions easy to answer, and didn’t mind that the questions weren’t perfectly parallel, but Lauren was stumped. I’ve noticed these things about him before, of course, but it was really useful to see the contrast with other people’s responses. His wrestling with the question gave more insight into his communication than mine. However, my frustrations with talking to him have often made me feel that there is something wrong with my communication, so this allowed me to see that in fact the problem I’ve been noticing says more about his abilities than mine. It was also refreshing to know that despite negative feedback he’s given me, he does value talking to me.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        How am I as a listener?  - 
                        Everyone was really positive about this. Krista said that I’m very attentive, and it really feels like I’m paying attention. John said that he’d give me 9 out of 10 on that, that I’m really paying attention and get what’s being said. He said I’m not one to listen just to decide what I’m going to say, but I’m actually listening to understand. Lauren said that I’m a really reliable listener. He said that we don’t have the same cultural context and that sometimes gets in the way, but we do have a similar amount of “talkiness” and that I understand when he’s that way.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I feel really good about this, because in the past my preoccupation with my own needs has kept me from really tuning in to other people, and I’ve worked hard to deal with my own needs and be able to listen. To have these people say that they can’t think of anything I could do better really makes me feel that my efforts have paid off. I doubt it means that I can’t improve by learning more, but it does mean I’ve reached the goal I set for myself a few years ago, which is very encouraging.

                        What aspects of my nonverbal behavior are effective? What can be improved?  - 
                        In this area, people mostly didn’t have conscious perceptions. Krista noticed I was leaning in while we were talking, and we had a good laugh when she pointed that out. She said I’m good with eye contact, and my non-verbals don’t draw attention to themselves; it feels just fine. She said I have an air of caring. John said my voice inflection is really good at emphasizing things that are important. He said my facial expressions are expressive, that I smile for agreement and look curious for questions. He said nothing jumps out, and everything seems normal. Lauren didn’t know how to gauge the answer, so I asked him how much my voice inflection matters to him (especially since we usually communicate by phone these days.) He said it matters to him more than average, and I volunteered that I think of myself as not using enough inflection, because I notice certain other people have a lot of it and are more interesting to listen to than I perceive myself as being. He said he has not noticed that I don’t use inflection, and is skeptical that I don’t. He said that if you’re looking for a thing, you’re the kind of person who cares about it, so I probably do it quite a bit.

                    <p> 
                        This pretty much matches what I thought, aside from wondering about inflection. I think Lauren’s observation about inflection is probably correct, that I notice examples of people using it because it is something I already do. The overall positive assessment about non-verbals matched my own, and was a nice confirmation of an area that I haven’t been worried about.

                        What are my communication strengths? - 
                        The overall assessment on this one was really positive about being interested in people. John said that my communication seems very strong, “pretty solid.” He said it’s almost like I calculate my comments to make sure they’ll be right. Krista said that she feels I’m genuinely interested. She said I ask questions to get to the meaning of things, I don’t just let it go when I don’t understand, and I’m not afraid to ask for clarity. This probably stands out for her especially because she believes in a lot of things I disagree with, and yet I enjoy talking to her when our group of friends are chewing the fat. Lauren said these questions are too hard for him, because he doesn’t feel like he shares my reference frame. He finds these kinds of questions hard enough for people who are culturally similar to him. Then he said, “I don’t want to do these questions any more, I want to show you my Oculus Rift.” We switched topics, and had a great time with that for the rest of the conversation.

                        The conversation with Leo gave some interesting examples, even though he wasn’t part of the interview. Krista and I were talking at the park, during a picnic for the Unitarian Church. Leo was standing off to the side of where other children were playing, where Krista saw him and called out asking what was wrong. He called over that he felt bad because he’d tried to play soccer with some of the other kids and they had told him to move out of the way. Krista called him over to talk to us, and he sat down on the blanket with us. Krista told him it will get better, and gave him advice about what to do. I thought it was important to validate his feelings, so I said it was understandable that he would feel bad for being asked not to do something he wanted to do. His mother also came up while we were talking, and spoke to him in a very non-empathic way that was painful to watch. I repeated to him that it makes sense he would feel bad after what the other kids said to him. His body language changed when I was talking to him; he clearly sat up straighter when he heard my comment, and slouched when he heard the others. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I have felt that my strengths are that I am really interested in other people and like to hear what they think. I also enjoy making people feel good when they talk to me. It’s very satisfying to hear that it’s coming across the way I’d hoped. Also, the aspect of my communication which Krista and John both said sounds like preparation or knowledgeability has felt a little different to me. That is, sometimes when I get done opining about something, I feel guilty for what I perceive as dominating the conversation. There have been times when I have chastised myself after a conversation for not having listened enough, and what I was picturing during that chastising is the thing John and Krista were talking about. But their feedback in this interview shows me that it doesn’t come across as dominating or failing to listen, it comes across as insightful and knowledgeable.

                        What are my communication weaknesses? - 
                        John said that spontaneity could be a weakness for me. He thought it was a minor point, but if there was something, it would be that I’m careful enough about what I say that I might not be giving voice to the things that are less thought through. Krista really couldn’t think of anything in this category. I asked if she ever noticed me zoning out and seeming indifferent, but she said no. She said I talk about it when I feel that way, so it doesn’t feel like a weakness, it feels like me being clear about my needs. Since Lauren wanted to stop doing the interview, I never got to this question with him, but in a way he did answer. For him, my weakness is that I’m not enough similar to him in the way he thinks.

                    <p> 
                        Another kind of weakness showed up with Leo. When everyone else was telling him what to do, I caught myself also doing that. He nodded at me and listened even when I lapsed into advice-giving, but I felt like part of a gang, all trying to make him suck up his emotions. Because I noticed it, I switched back to validating his emotions, but it was pretty hard to keep up when everyone else was doing other things. One of those people was his mother, who said to him, “How do you think your father will feel if you sit here and talk when he is waiting?” He obviously wanted some kind words from her and she had none. When he had picked up his head to look at me talking to him, he noticed me knitting and said, “Oh, you’re knitting!” I nodded and smiled, and his mother said, “She’s not knitting, she’s crocheting. I know, because I knit. Now come on, your dad’s waiting in the car.” I was dumbstruck that she would bother asserting I was not knitting when I clearly was, and my response was to say nothing. Her non-verbal communication while she spoke was very dismissive; otherwise it would be easy to think that she was just in a hurry and making a mistake. I looked at Krista while the mother was scolding Leo, but neither of us said anything. I consider my failure to speak up a weakness that needs to be corrected. Her meaningless assertion about knitting was one thing, and her belittling words to her son were another. Leo needs people who can name what’s happening, so he can have the tools he needs to deal with the obvious problem his mother’s communication presents to him. Speaking up would have mattered to him. I don’t think this is a prominent weakness in the way I communicate, just a relatively normal response to a challenging communication situation. But I want to learn how to handle it better, because when it does occur, learning to speak up and what to say can make a difference in the life of a child.

                        What is it like to have a conversation with me?  - 
                        John said that it’s like ice cream and lollipops. I laughed and asked him what he meant, and he said, “Well, it’s more like steak dinner, because it has more substance than sugar.” Krista said that I’m very engaged and it feels like I’m genuinely interested. I’ll include Leo here too because of the obvious response he had when I was talking to him: he looked at me and sat up straighter. I interpret that as a sign that my words helped him feel better about himself. Lauren didn’t answer this but the way he talks to me often starts off with a lot of description of something on his mind, and then switches to showing me something he’s doing on the computer. He starts out with an idea he wants to share with me, which he prefers to be pretty much a monologue. When his words run out, he switches to showing something. Since he keeps coming to me for those kinds of conversations, it suggests that he finds them satisfying enough for his needs.

                        Overall, people seem to find it nourishing to have a conversation with me, and I’m very pleased about this. At the time of life I’m in, it’s important to me to be building relationships with many kinds of people, so I’m thrilled to find that I have a stronger base to work with than I’d realized. It seems like I have a great group of friends, and there’s a reason I like to hang out with them. It also is encouraging to me that my autistic son can get so much out of our conversations, because I really do care so much about him and want him to thrive to the best of his ability.

                        Conclusion  - 
                        Over my life, I’ve needed to learn to speak my needs so that I could own my need to tell my own story. The anxiety I felt before I learned how to do that interfered with my ability to notice other people. As I’ve learned to express myself better, I’ve gotten better at relaxing enough to be able to notice the emotional state and body language of the people I’m talking to. What I’ve learned from this exercise is that I’m actually doing pretty well, and can relax even more while using the skills I’ve already learned. There are people who have specific needs that don’t lend themselves to everyday patter, and their needs require me as a listener to be attentive if I want to figure out what to do. Now that I know I am working with a strong base, I can turn my attention to considering more carefully what their needs may be. I can also allow myself more opportunities to be spontaneous, and enjoy conversations that aren’t planned or thought out, knowing that people do enjoy that as well.

                        My biggest take-away from this experience is that it's useful
                        to ask questions. None of what I learned from this could have
                        happened if I hadn't been asking myself questions and making
                        an effort to answer them systematically. That's my take-away 
                        from several classes this semester, so my new goal is to start
                        a question log and make a practice of asking and trying to answer
                        specific questions.
