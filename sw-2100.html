                bullying (both personal and cyber), prevalence of bullying, effects
                of bullying, warning signs of bullying, parental involvement if they

            <h4>Problem #1: </h4>
            <p>
                Children who are bullied should not be expected to handle 
                it alone. They are not in a conflict where both child and 
                bully are partly right and partly wrong. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They are being 
                victimized because there is a power imbalance between the 
                child and the bully. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                This is described in information about 
                bullying provided by the United States government at 
                <a 
                    href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/" 
                    class="a-plain">stopbullying.gov
                </a>
                , in the description “What Is Bullying” 
                and their document 
                <a 
                    href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/sites/default/files/2017-10/misdirections-in-prevention.pdf"

            <h4>Goal #1: </h4>
            <p>
                When a child tells their parent they’ve been bullied at 
                school, parents should be informed how to respond in a way 
                that protects the child.
            </p>
            <p>
                Objective 1.1: Engagingly list kinds of responses parents 
                can give that will protect the child, so that parents have 
                context for what they will say.
            </p>
            <p>
                Objective 1.2: Illustrate sample responses parents can use 
                to convey to the child how the child will be protected.
            </p>
            <h4>Intervention for Goal #1: </h4>
            <p>
                An infographic of parent responses to their child has been 
                prepared, which can be printed and given to parents. The 
                responses include sample wording parents can use as the 
                basis for their own responses, in each of several categories 
                designed to show the child that their parent is going to protect them. 
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <h4>Problem #2: </h4>
            <p>
                Parents don’t automatically know what to say to their 
                children who say they’ve been bullied, as evidenced by my 
                own experience as a parent. When I looked for help for what 
                to say when my son told me he was being bullied at school, 
                the information I had said to have the child work it out. 
                When I reached out for more information online at the time, 
                I found more of the same. Parents need to know about the 
                information at 
                <a 
                    href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/" 
                    class="a-plain">stopbullying.gov
                </a>
                and how they can use it.
            </p>
            <h4>Goal #2: </h4>
            <p>
                Help the parents be prepared to follow up on behalf of their child.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure parents have the information they 
                need to follow up on what they told the child they would do.
            </p>
            <h4>Internvention for Goal #2: </h4>
            <p>
                The infographic includes an area to write down names and 
                phone numbers of school staff with roles in protecting children from bullying.
                These numbers should be made available to the parents at the time
                the infographic is given to them, and they should be guided
                and encouraged to ensure they write the numbers down so that
                if follow-up is needed, the contacts will be readily available.
