            <summary>The Crisis in South Sudan</summary>
            
            <p>The Need for International Action in South Sudan</p>
            <p>
                South Sudan is the youngest country in the UN, as a result of a vote for independence in 2011. Religious differences between Muslims, Christians, and spiritualist Africans as well as ethnic differences had been causing violence for more than 20 years at the time of independence. The UN Mission for South Sudan, UNMISS, was created in 2011 to support the new country in establishing its new government. But the new independence was on shaky ground, and in 2013, violence broke out in the capital, Juba, as well as other places. The president, Salva Kiir, blamed the vice president, Riek Machar, saying Machar had attempted a coup. The two were members of different tribes; the president was an ethnic Dinka, the vice president was an ethnic Nuer, and these two dominant tribes have been rivals for a long time. This fighting lasted on and off for two years before a peace agreement was finally signed in 2015.  However, the agreement did not hold, and in 2016 new fighting broke out. Hundreds of people were killed, and thousands were displaced as they fled areas of violence. President Kiir replaced the vice president with General Taban Deng Gai. Conditions have continued to worsen, and severe conditions have prevailed as South Sudan, already the least developed of any world nation, has experienced constant disruption of its economy and transportation (UNMISS, n.d.).
            <p>
                Currently, severe conditions exist throughout the country. About 2.3 million people have left South Sudan for surrounding countries, and 1.8 million are displaced internally.  Two-thirds of the population, about 7 million people, are in need of aid, and food security is at crisis levels in many areas (Mercy Corps, 2019). Militias, which include child soldiers in forced conscription, roam the countryside and contribute to ethnic fighting and to fighting between the president and former vice president. The UN has authorized up to 17,000 troops, and as much as half the population is depending on UN assistance. Many people who were fleeing violence gather at UN facilities for protection, and UNMISS found themselves in the unusual situation of having to create centers for protection of civilians, which they have called PoC’s (UNMISS, n.d.).
            </p>
            <p>
                Cattle is a primary source of wealth for Sudanese, and youth are charged with keeping the cattle. However, the tribes have raided each other for cattle, and then get locked in battles of retribution. Muwangala (2019), for example, reports that UN peacekeeping forces intervened when they received a tip about an imminent raid. To underscore the harsh conditions in South Sudan, the cattle in the image used in Muwangala’s story are noticeably underfed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many dimensions to the problem in South Sudan. At the time of independence, the country was undeveloped, and people’s resources had been depleted by 20 years of fighting. Ethnic and religious differences did not get fixed by independence, although it did separate the South Sudanese from the Muslim majority who practice Sharia in Sudan. The practice of conscripting child soldiers, a form of child abuse, is widespread in South Sudan, and sexual assault is also a common practice. Skårås (2018) reports that even if the children are released from this service, they have missed school, been traumatized, and have no economic hope, so they often return to the militias. Cattle raids embroil neighboring communities in battles, especially during dry seasons when cattle must be herded to areas where they can graze and water. Farming is disrupted by fighting, and most of the country has no roads, so even for those who do get a crop, getting it to market is extremely difficult. Aid has been sent from the UN and various organizations, but it is being stolen by corrupt officials. Mednick (2019) reports in the Guardian that money meant to give aid has been spent on renovating the mansion of the new vice president, General Gai. The Sentry (2016) has done an extensive investigation of the finances of the government leaders, and have found documents and evidence of corruption and pillaging of aid, as well as money laundering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the complexity of the situation, many different steps need to be taken in coordination. For example, the Sentry recommends a list of actions including efforts to rout out money laundering, and Skårås reports that child protection agencies have interventions for “healing” schools to help former child soldiers with trauma while catching them up on missed school. At the same time, actions need to be taken to disarm the militias and stop the cattle raids, so that when the other actions are being taken, militias don’t interfere with the progress. UNMISS programs to coordinate meetings across communities can get people talking to each other to solve problems. With support, progress can be made, but without support, many millions of people are likely to continue to suffer.

                <b>The process of completing the assignment </b><br>
            </p>
            <p> 
            Recently, the podcaster Dr Peter Attia interviewed Dr Tom Catena,
                the only doctor in a remote area of South Sudan. I was moved by
                Dr Catena's description of the harsh conditions there, so when
                it was time to select a topic about UN peacekeeping operations, 
                I chose this area to learn about. Navigating the UN website was
                a bit amusing, because clearly they have not spent a lot of money
                on their site design, so it has the style of an earlier era of 
                websites. It felt full of an overwhelming amount of information, 
                that seemed likely to be more significant than it looks. Ultimately
                it was full of fascinating and touching information. Additional 
                web searches also turned up some great work by independent 
                journalists and by scholars. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Connecting the content to other areas of study</b><br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                One of my takeaways from this project is that although the situation
                is complex and dire, some great work has been done to identify
                what can help, and specific suggestions given. Like many apparently
                intractable domains, people do make headway, but difficulty coming
                together to take the actions needed is where the problem lies. In my 
                human origins class, I was struck by a video of macaque monkeys, blissfully
                warding off cold weather in a hot spring - but then chasing away
                the fellow macaques who were a lower social status. This and other
                examples reminded me that our social behaviors are deeply evolutionary,
                and not just a matter of correcting someone's superficial thinking
                mistakes. In my geology class, a video about the ocean showed a 
                school of mackerel swimming together without a leader. 'How do they
                make decisions about where to go?' the video asked. The answer is that
                they all respond to each other's actions. The video applied this to
                human action on climate change, saying that no one person can fix
                it but that since we influence each other, sharing our understanding
                can spread that influence. In this class I learned that although 
                many people believe in Realism and that conflict is unavoidable, this
                doesn't explain all human behavior. Maybe there will always be human
                outcasts, like the macaques, but we can construct worldviews that
                affect institutions and norms, and contribute to the directio of 
                the human swarm. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>How this has contributed to my intellectual growth</b><br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                The most valuable thing about this exercise was that I was asked
                a specific question and then given time to spend answering it. I 
                have a lot of questions about the world, and often take a hand-waving
                approach to finding answers. This exercise makes me realize that 
                I can benefit by being a little more systematic about my questions
                and planning ways to make time to answer them.
